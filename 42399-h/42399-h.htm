<p class="first">The present volume is devoted to a further installment
of Aduarte&rsquo;s <i lang="es">Historia</i>, begun in <span class=
"sc">Vol. XXX</span>&mdash;which work will be completed in our next
issue. The part here given covers the years 1596 to 1608 in the history
of the Dominican order in the Philippines.</p>
<p>Resuming Aduarte&rsquo;s account of the missions carried on by his
order among the Indians of Cagay&aacute;n, in northern Luz&oacute;n,
the pious and devout acts of their converts, and the joy and gratitude
of the religious thereat, are recounted at length. In 1596, news comes
to the islands of the death of Bishop Salazar in Spain. Aduarte
describes in detail the life, achievements, and virtues of that
prelate. He was distinguished&mdash;not only in the Philippines, but
during a long residence in Nueva Espa&ntilde;a&mdash;as the friend and
protector of the Indian natives. His mode of life was most simple and
austere; he was charitable and generous to the full extent of his
limited means. By nature choleric and quick-tempered, he trained
himself to patience and forbearance; and the slanders of the
evil-minded against him only roused his compassion. He was
public-spirited, and foremost in all enterprises for the good of the
community. To him are attributed the royal grant to the Jesuits for
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb10" href="#pb10" name=
"pb10">10</a>]</span>maintaining a school, and the establishment and
much of the endowment of the hospital for sick Indians.</p>
<p>Bishop Salazar&rsquo;s journey to Spain enables him to secure for
his cathedral important aid, and the division of his diocese, so that
its manifold duties may be more satisfactorily performed; soon
afterward, he dies at Madrid. During his absence, his see is directed
by his vicar-general, Fray Christobal de Salvatierra, to an account of
whose exemplary life, valuable labors, and apostolic virtues a chapter
is devoted. He protects the Indians, and does much to reform the morals
of the Spaniards. Among other things, he compels the Chinese to cease
such of their theatrical performances as contain idolatrous and
superstitious matter; and obliges the Spaniards to give up attendance
at these comedies. It is he who begins the spiritual conquest of the
Cagay&aacute;n region, and he goes on other expeditions; and he assumes
charge of the Bata&aacute;n mission until missionaries come for that
field. At his death, he appoints two Dominicans to assume his duties as
vicar-general; but they are so opposed by the ecclesiastical cabildo
that they resign the office to the latter. Next comes a biographical
sketch of the younger Juan de Castro, who is assigned to the toilsome
and difficult mission of Pangasin&aacute;n. In December, 1593, he
accompanies an embassy to China; on the return voyage, the ship is
wrecked. Castro escapes to land, but soon afterward dies as a result of
the shock and exposure thus suffered.</p>
<p>Aduarte recounts, with much detail, the expedition of 1596 to
Cambodia, which is accompanied by himself and another Dominican, Fray
Alonso Ximenez. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb11" href="#pb11" name=
"pb11">11</a>]</span>Velloso&rsquo;s junk is driven ashore by a storm,
and the men, after much privation and suffering, make it over into a
shallow oared vessel, and row along the coast in search of water and
inhabited places. When reduced to the last extremity, they accidentally
find fresh water, and thus are saved, finally making their way to a
fort where some Cambojan soldiers are stationed. From these the
Spaniards learn that the king who was friendly to them has been driven
out by a usurper, and that one of their consorts in the Spanish fleet
has reached that country. They join this ship, and soon afterward,
learning that the king is plotting to destroy them all, and coming to
blows with the Chinese traders who have come to Chordemuco, the
Spaniards attack the Cambojans at night and defeat them, killing the
usurper of that throne. The Spanish commander Gallinato arrives, and
decides to return to Manila; but contrary winds force them to land at
Malaca, after twice encountering enemies. Nearly a year later, they
succeed in reaching Manila, without other result of their journey
&ldquo;but that of having suffered for the gospel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In 1596, Fray Bernardo de Santa Catharina is elected provincial;
under his rule, the conversion of the natives greatly increases. A new
band of missionaries arrives soon afterward, most of whom go to the
Cagay&aacute;n field. In Cambodia Velloso and Blas Ruiz, Spanish
adventurers, have aided the lawful king to regain his throne, and they
persuade him to send to Manila requesting soldiers and the return of
the two Dominican friars. Luis P&eacute;rez Dasmari&ntilde;as offers to
make this expedition at his own cost, and Aduarte and Ximenez accompany
him. A <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb12" href="#pb12" name=
"pb12">12</a>]</span>fierce storm scatters the ships; that of
Dasmari&ntilde;as is driven upon the coast of China, and that in which
Aduarte sails is wrecked on one of the Babuyanes group. He sends word
of this misfortune to Manila; the governor orders the Spaniards to
proceed to China, on which coast they again suffer shipwreck, but find
Dasmari&ntilde;as&mdash;who has met a like disaster there, and is
enduring great privations. Aduarte has meanwhile returned to Manila;
but word of Dasmari&ntilde;as&rsquo;s misfortune reaches that place,
and Governor Tello sends him a ship with aid, and orders to return at
once to Manila. Aduarte accompanies this vessel. He goes to Canton, to
obtain the viceroy&rsquo;s permission for Dasmari&ntilde;as&rsquo;s
return to Manila; but there falls into the hands of a greedy and
corrupt official, who, thinking to extort money from the friar, has him
tortured. Finally, Aduarte is placed in prison with the Spanish
sailors, but is soon bailed out by a Chinese friend. He makes his
escape, and joins Dasmari&ntilde;as; the latter returns to Manila, but
Aduarte&rsquo;s health is so injured that he is obliged to halt at
Macao. Fray Alonso Ximenez dies at that place, as a result of his
hardships and sufferings in the Camboja expedition; a sketch of his
life and virtues is given.</p>
<p>In 1597 another mission arrives at the islands, with Bishop
Benavides. The intermediate chapter of the Dominican province is in
session, and the new arrivals are therefore assigned to the needy
missions; various incidents in those of Cagay&aacute;n and Pangasinan
are related. Biographical sketches of Antonio de Soria and other
pioneer missionaries are given. Two of these are sent (1598) on a
politico-religious mission to Camboja, with a Spanish officer named
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb13" href="#pb13" name=
"pb13">13</a>]</span>Mendoza; they are attacked by Malays, and most of
the Spaniards are slain. The rest escape to Siam, but are attacked
there also, with further loss of life. Among the dead are the two
Dominicans and Mendoza.</p>
<p>At the chapter-session of 1600, Juan de Santo Thomas is elected
provincial. The Cagay&aacute;n missions are extended further into the
interior; and the religious zealously pursue and destroy any trace of
idol-worship. At the intermediate chapter of 1602, the house of San
Juan del Monte, without the city, is established as a retreat for
convalescent brethren of the order. At that time occurs a miraculous
healing of a friar possessed by an evil spirit; also, a large band of
missionaries arrives from Spain, being divinely aided to escape various
dangers of pestilence and shipwreck. With these friars all the convents
in the province are supplied, and some even go to Japan. Aduarte
explains the reason for Dominican missionaries being called to that
country, and describes their first establishment, which is in
Satsuma.</p>
<p>In 1603 the new king of Camboja asks the Manila government for
soldiers and missionaries. Three Dominicans are sent, with a few
soldiers as guards, and letters to the king. They are well received;
but two of them die, and the factions in that country and the
fickleness of the natives induce the remaining friar to return to
Manila. In April, 1604, occurs the great conflagration in Manila, and,
in the succeeding autumn, the revolt and massacre of the Chinese in and
near that city&mdash;which have been fully described in previous
volumes.</p>
<p>At the chapter of 1604, Fray Miguel de San Jacinto is elected
provincial, and several new churches <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb14" href="#pb14" name="pb14">14</a>]</span>in heathen communities
are received. These are supplied with ministers from a new company that
arrives that year from Spain. Some account is given of the journey of
these friars, with its hardships and dangers&mdash;among these being an
attack made upon them by hostile Indians at Guadalupe Island, in which
six friars are slain and three wounded. Many of these new missionaries
are sent to the Cagay&aacute;n missions&mdash;some to the Itaves
Indians, who were considered fierce and untamable by the Spaniards
(some of whom, having oppressed the natives, were slain by them) until
&ldquo;the holy gospel declared by the Dominican religious changed them
from bloodthirsty wolves to gentle sheep.&rdquo; Aduarte declares that
wonderful results were thus achieved, rendering those Indians moral and
obedient, and achieving this entirely by kindness and gentleness. The
Indians even consent to change their abodes to the mission reductions.
The fathers are almost worn out by these tasks, and one dies; but they
are encouraged by the wonderful results of their labor and by miracles
which the Lord vouchsafes them.</p>
<p>Aduarte presents a long biographical account of Archbishop
Benavides, Salazar&rsquo;s immediate successor. He is distinguished in
Spain, both as a student and as an instructor. Coming to the
Philippines, he immediately undertakes to learn the Chinese language,
that he may minister to the men of that nation who come to Manila; and
founds a hospital for the poor sick Chinese there. Benavides goes to
China (as previously narrated), and afterward to Spain. There he does
good service in refuting the opinion prevalent there that conquest must
precede conversion, and soldiers clear the way for missionaries. He
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb15" href="#pb15" name=
"pb15">15</a>]</span>also procures the recall of a papal brief
authorizing the bishops to visit the friars in charge of the Indians,
the same as if they were parish priests; and accomplishes other
important business, especially in behalf of the Indians, winning golden
opinions of his abilities, good judgment, and virtue. Returning to the
islands, Benavides takes charge of the diocese of Nueva Segovia, where
he labors zealously for the moral improvement of the Spaniards, but
most of all for the protection of the Indians from Spanish rapacity.
After Salazar&rsquo;s death, Benavides takes charge of the vacant see,
and is finally appointed archbishop; but his mode of life is always as
simple and austere as that of the poorest friar, and he spends all his
income in almsgiving. At his death, he bequeaths the little that he
possesses to his brethren, for the founding of a college at Manila.
Biographical accounts of other friars are presented. One of these,
Jacinto Pardo, dies suddenly, it is supposed from poison given him by
hostile Indians. Another, Juan de la Cruz, is a notable linguist.</p>
<p>In 1605, a papal brief (obtained by the Jesuits) forbids any
religious to go to Japan except by way of India; but it is revoked
three years later. This, in the interim, causes the friar orders much
trouble; and Japan, moreover, is greatly unsettled and disturbed by
various political matters. In 1606 an intermediate chapter is held at
Manila, at which the religious of the order are directed to collect
materials (of which Aduarte has availed himself) for a history of the
Dominican province. The great victory of Acu&ntilde;a at Maluco, which
occurs about that time, is ascribed to the agency of our Lady of the
Rosary, to whom the Dominicans have a special devotion; <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb16" href="#pb16" name="pb16">16</a>]</span>a
confraternity in her honor had been founded in Acu&ntilde;a&rsquo;s
army, and the captured town is dedicated to her. In this same year,
another company of religious arrives from Spain; one dies before
reaching Manila. At this time, a Dominican mission is established in
the province of Hizen, Japan.</p>
<p>In 1605 the mission in Pangasinan is extended to the village of
Man&aacute;oag, farther inland; and, &ldquo;within a few months, there
was not a heathen in the village.&rdquo; A chief in a neighboring
village is also converted, to whom a miracle occurs. In 1607, two new
churches are established in Cagay&aacute;n. In Nalfotan the Indians,
led by their excellent chief, build a church even before a missionary
is sent to them; and all is prospering when a priestess of the old
idols stirs up the people, against the new faith, and the villagers
take to the hills. Later, they burn the church; but the good chief
saves the missionary&rsquo;s life. Another revolt occurs in that
province, caused by the cruelty of an encomendero. Troops are sent from
Manila; their commander finds that the Indians had cause for revolt,
and sends the people of Nalfotan home with their pastor. This mission
prospers, and the chief is its mainstay during his life&mdash;a
function long continued by his pious sister.</p>
<p>The provincial chosen in 1608 is Baltasar Fort. Some account is
given of the persecution of Christians in Japan; they are banished from
Satsuma, but many find shelter in Nagasaki. The Dominicans accomplish
much in Hizen. They also extend their missionary labors among the wild
mountaineers of northern Luz&oacute;n, gathering many scattered hamlets
into larger villages, and converting many of their <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb17" href="#pb17" name="pb17">17</a>]</span>heathen
inhabitants. In Ituy they attempt to open a mission, but the
Franciscans claim that as their territory; the Dominicans yield, but
regret to see these Indians abandoned soon afterward by their
Franciscan teachers. In 1609 the general of their order commands the
provincials of the mission provinces to report every year the work and
achievements of the missionaries, with information regarding the
numbers and condition of the order in each province. Several friars die
in that year, of whom biographical sketches are presented. One of
these, Pedro Rodriguez, has rendered special and distinguished service
in the hospital for Chinese at Manila.</p>

<h3 class="main">The advance made by the Indians of this province in
virtue, and their attendance upon the sacraments</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Even if the religious in this province of Nueva
Segovia had done no other good than bringing to an end or preventing so
many sins of idolatry as these Indians used to commit, every day and
every hour, by adoring the devil and offering him superstitious
reverence in all the ways which have already been described, a very
great service indeed would have been done to the Lord, to whom all such
actions as these are directly offensive. In these idolatrous acts His
honor is taken from Him, and His divine supremacy is overthrown and
given to His greatest enemy. To prevent one of these offenses to God
would be of much more merit than to prevent any homicide whatsoever,
for that is a direct offense only against a man; while idolatry is
directly against God, and takes from Him His divine honor, which is
much more valuable than the life of a man. If this be true, how high is
the merit of having prevented the innumerable acts <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb24" href="#pb24" name="pb24">24</a>]</span>of
idolatry which used to be committed daily by those Indians, and having
brought to an end the multitude of sins which followed upon this
one&mdash;constant wars, murders, robberies, drunkennesses which
surpassed one another, lewd actions, and all the other vices which were
committed&mdash;without the rulers of those people concerning
themselves the least in them or punishing them, except when they
personally were wronged. And this they did, not out of zeal for
justice, but as their personal act of revenge, so that they sinned more
in the excess of the punishment than the delinquents had sinned in the
faults for which they were punished. Now all these evils came to an
end, as the result of the preaching of the religious, to the great
glory of God. Hence, if they had done no more than this, very great
indeed would the service have been which thereby they wrought and
continue to work for the Creator of all and the universal Lord. But
this was not all; for when these evil growths had been rooted out,
there were planted in the hearts of these Indians the opposite virtues.
By the aid of the Lord they began so soon to bear flowers and fruit
that the first bishop of this province, Don Fray Miguel de Venavides, a
holy and most learned prelate, wrote to his Holiness Clement VIII, who
at that time governed the church, the following report, in which he
gives a faithful account of the establishment of his bishopric, with
the accuracy to which his office and dignity obliged him. &ldquo;This
province,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;is very new in the preaching of the
gospel, for it is only three years since there were ministers of the
Order of St. Dominic in it. Before that time there used to be seen now
and then a priest in the place where the Spaniards lived. As for
preaching to the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb25" href="#pb25" name=
"pb25">25</a>]</span>Indians, there was no idea of such a thing. This
province is very near Great China, being distant from it less than
seventy leguas; so that now the faith of the Lord appears to be
approaching their powerful and great kingdom. The native race of the
province is a very spirited one, whom it has cost the Spaniards many
efforts and the lives of many men to subdue. As soon as the Order of
St. Dominic came into this region, they immediately went to live among
the Indians; and they built their churches and houses, which were more
like huts built to last two days. They employed upon them very few
laborers, and had no teacher or journeymen. The Indians would have died
before they admitted them to their villages (and, as it was, there was
some difficulty about it), if the good name of those who had been in
Pangasinan had not reached these Indians also&mdash;who in this way
learned how the religious treated the Indians as if they were their own
children, and defended them against those who wronged them. When they
began to consider the mode of life followed by the religious, their
patience and labors, their avoidance of flesh food, their many fasts,
continual prayers, great poverty&mdash;for the poverty of the Order of
St. Dominic here is very great&mdash;and the gentleness and love with
which they treated the natives, God was pleased that in those villages
where there are missionary religious, all the inhabitants desired to be
Christians. They have not only become very devout toward God, but very
friendly to the Spaniards; thus the religious have put peace and
security where they were not before. As a result, in regions where
soldiers and garrisons used to be necessary, there now are none, and
the country is very peaceful. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb26" href=
"#pb26" name="pb26">26</a>]</span>Every evening the men gather together
and recite prayers before a cross, which is usually set up in the plaza
of the village, the women doing the same by themselves in another
place. Baptisms in the heathen villages are constantly increasing,
while those for whom there are not missionaries enough ask for them
with all their hearts, and are so desirous to become Christians that we
ought therefore to offer thanks to God. [Some chiefs invited the
missionaries to their village, saying that they all wished to become
Christians. A Spaniard who had command in one village where they were
building a church, directed the soldiers to interfere with the work,
which would have injured his private interests; but within a short time
all those men died horribly. The fathers drive out devils from those
who are possessed by them. It is only for lack of missionaries that the
whole country is not filled with churches.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The report is very short, and it is therefore necessary for us to
expand upon it, making use of the reports of the founders and first
missionaries themselves. In addition to what has already been said,
they report as follows. Great as was the labor of bringing these souls
from darkness to light, they have come to understand their duties,
worshiping the Lord with great devotion, and regularly attending His
holy sacraments. They go beyond the commandments of God and of His
church to do additional works of devotion&mdash;especially the women,
for they can more easily come to be instructed, and can more easily do
what they are told, as they are less occupied than the men are with
things to distract their minds and thoughts. Some of them are so devout
that they walk always in the presence of God, doing nothing
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb27" href="#pb27" name=
"pb27">27</a>]</span>without an inward prayer to Him. In Tular, or
Abulug, a village of more than a thousand inhabitants, in which there
were more communicants than in the other villages, the religious taught
many of them to strive to meditate every day upon some of the mysteries
of the rosary. This was an exercise to which the first founder of the
province, father Fray Juan de Castro, was very much given, and in which
many of his disciples and subjects have followed him. Thus these
Indians day by day meditate upon one after another of the fifteen
mysteries of the rosary. Other Indians lay aside part of their daily
food for charity. Bringing about these results requires from the
minister much labor, teaching, assistance, perseverance, and prayer;
for without these there is very little or nothing that they can do of
themselves, without books or any other guide to direct them. As it is,
the Indians have advanced wonderfully&mdash;visiting and caring for
their sick, especially when they are poor; taking discipline at night
in their houses; fasting beyond what they are required; frequenting the
churches; and offering their prayers at dawn and at evening. There were
some of them who, at the very beginning of their Christian career, went
through the fields looking for the little children of poor people who
could not take them to town; and, bringing these to be baptized, they
acted as their sponsors, making gifts to them afterward of
swaddling-clothes or some such thing. Heavy as are the labors of the
religious, their joy in them is still greater.</p>
<p>Very great difficulty was found, at first, in bringing the Indians
to confess. They regarded it as a shameful thing for them to report to
the confessor all the evil things they had done and thought, and
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb28" href="#pb28" name=
"pb28">28</a>]</span>they also feared to give the religious power to
annoy or blame them by means of their confession. &ldquo;When a dozen
persons were gathered together for their first confession, there was
not one of them who was willing to begin, for everyone wished the other
to make the experiment. At last the fathers summoned an Indian who came
from Pangasinan, and who had longer been a Christian and was better
acquainted with the fathers. The Indians asked him many questions about
the matter, all of which he answered well, encouraging them greatly; he
told them that in his country the Christians confessed without any evil
results following. At last one Indian woman, more courageous than the
rest, ventured to go to make her confession where the father was
patiently waiting in the church&mdash;commending the matter to God with
all his heart, because it was very plain that the hesitation of the
Indians was on account of the fear they felt. She confessed, went away
very well satisfied, and, returning to the rest, told them what had
happened. They asked her a thousand new questions, especially if the
father was angry when she told her sins, and whether he had scolded
her. She answered &lsquo;No,&rsquo; and that, on the contrary, he had
treated her very kindly and lovingly; so they all determined to make
their confessions, and began them heartily.&rdquo; So they come now and
make their confessions; and in general it is not necessary to summon
them, for they anticipate the confessors, and sometimes even beg that
their confessions may be heard, as a penance. They showed the greatest
faith and sincerity in their confessions, striving to be reconciled
with all their enemies before making their confession. The religious
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb29" href="#pb29" name=
"pb29">29</a>]</span>generally encouraged them to make their
confessions on the day of their patron saint; and one Indian woman,
named for St. Anne, was unwilling to confess on that saint&rsquo;s day.
When the father asked her the reason, she answered that she had had a
quarrel with one of her neighbors, and that they did not speak to each
other; and she begged the father to reconcile them. After he had done
that, she very readily made her confession. It frequently happens that
a man accused in a court of law denies the accusation, and that the
religious is unable to draw anything else from him; while in confession
the same man will clearly accuse himself of the same fault which he had
previously denied, and will deny again if the same question is asked
him on another trial. It not infrequently happens that if they have any
ill-will against the religious, or have said anything against him, they
confess to that very man, telling him of the ill-will that they have
felt against him.]</p>

<h3 class="main">The devotion with which these Indians approached the
holy communion, and some events which give much glory to the Lord.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">[Since the most holy sacrament of the Eucharist is so
high and difficult a thing to teach a people whose heathen state makes
them opposed to ideas so lofty, the religious in this region spend a
great deal of effort upon teaching the Indians this supreme mystery.]
At first, only very few and very carefully chosen persons were admitted
to the communion, according to the ordinance of a provincial council
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb30" href="#pb30" name=
"pb30">30</a>]</span>of Lima, confirmed by the Apostolic See, which in
Act ii, chapter 20, says,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e353src" href=
"#xd21e353" name="xd21e353src">1</a> <i lang="la">Precepit sancta
sinodus parochis, ceterisque Indorum praedicatoribus, ut saepe ac
serio, de fide huius mysterii eos instituant</i>; and, later, <i lang=
"la">Quos autem parochus, et satis instructus, et correctione vitae
idoneos iudicaverit, iis saltem in paschate, Eucharistiam administrare
non praetermittat</i>. It is true that the Indians of these regions
have much greater capacity than those of Peru, of whom this council
spoke; yet because they were so new in the faith, and so badly fitted
by their ancient customs for this supreme mystery, the holy communion
is not given to them indifferently at Easter, but is given to those
whom the minister judges to be properly prepared. At the beginning,
greater attention and caution were necessary. Hence, after they had
been thoroughly instructed in the mysteries of the faith, and in
particular in the doctrine of this holy mystery, and when they showed a
desire to receive the holy communion, they were examined as to their
lives, habits, and reputation, the most credible witnesses in the
village being called in to testify. If they were found prepared, they
were admitted to this supreme meal, to this holy table. A week before
they communicated, unless they were occupied&mdash;and they generally
gave up their occupations for this purpose&mdash;they went to church
and heard spiritual addresses every day. [On these days they prepared
themselves with more than ordinary prayer, and rose <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb31" href="#pb31" name="pb31">31</a>]</span>at
midnight to pray and to take their discipline. If they were married,
they separated their beds at least on the eve and the day of the
communion. Many of the men went to the convent, and followed the hours
with the religious. On the day of receiving communion, they followed
the same customs as did the members of our order, dedicating the whole
day to God, and keeping in it the silence which we observe in our
convents on the day when those religious who are not priests
communicate. They were taught to say something after mass in order to
give thanks to the Lord; for since they cannot read, and have no books,
the ministers have to teach them everything of this
kind&mdash;especially at the beginning, for afterward there are many of
them who teach the others. At the same time, they receive what the
minister tells them with greater respect. Many extraordinary examples
of piety have been exhibited by the communicants.] In the village of
Pata there was an Indian chief, a man of great valor, named Don
Francisco Yringan, of whom mention has several times been made. He,
being governor there, had as a guest in his house a Spaniard who was
traveling that way. He treated him kindly and entertained him as well
as he could. The guest, not being content with this, asked him to find
an Indian woman, that he might sleep with her; and gave him some
trinkets with which to gratify her. But the Indian refused to accept
them and to do what the Spaniard asked him, saying that this was wicked
and that no one ought to do such a thing, least of all a communicant.
This was a reply with which the old Christian ought to have been put to
confusion, and which should have made him correct his desires; but
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb32" href="#pb32" name=
"pb32">32</a>]</span>it was not so; on the contrary, he grew angry at
the answer, and threatened to cane the Indian unless he did what he was
told. The Indian turned his back and bending his head said, &ldquo;Give
me as much of a caning as you please, for I am not going to do what you
ask.&rdquo; The Spaniard was so intemperate and discourteous that he
vented his anger upon him and caned him, the Indian suffering with
great patience, as if he had received from God not only faith in Him,
but the power of suffering because he refused to offend Him. This is a
grace which the Apostle praises, urging the Philippians to esteem it
highly; and now it was found in a Philippine Indian. The Indian who
suffered this was a man who could have employed lawyers against him who
wronged him, though he was alone; and, if he had shouted to his
followers, they would have cut the Spaniard to pieces. But, as he was a
communicant, he would neither be an accomplice in the sin of the
Spaniard, nor would he avenge himself; nor would he even make use of a
just defense, as was taught in the counsel of Paul quoted above,
<i lang="la">Non vos defendentes carissimi</i> [<i>i.e.</i>, &ldquo;Not
defending yourselves, beloved&rdquo;]. On another occasion when a great
insult was offered to this same Indian, a religious comforted him and
encouraged him to patience. The Indian answered: &ldquo;O father, how
good it would be if we all served God with truth. If it were so, that
wrong which has been done to me would not have been done. If this thing
had happened in the days of our heathendom, it would have sufficed to
cause me and my followers to make war to the death against this town;
but now that we are Christians, patience!&rdquo; He said nothing more
and uttered not a word of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb33" href=
"#pb33" name="pb33">33</a>]</span>indignation, but passed over his
sufferings and endured the insult, although he felt it keenly and was
ashamed (though in a very Christian manner). Thus he gave proof that
his virtue was enduring, because such a blow could not overthrow it.
There was one poor Indian slave woman whom a Spaniard, who had
communicated a few days before in that village, tried to violate. She
resisted him with spirit; and, as if horrified at the lack of respect
which by his actions he showed to the Lord, whom he had received, she
said to him: &ldquo;How is it that, being a communicant, you dare to
commit such a sin?&rdquo; In this way may be seen how some of the new
Christians surpass others who are old in the faith, going beyond them
in virtue, devotion, and the fear of God. [In the village of Masi,
which is near to that of which we have been speaking, there was an
Indian, a communicant, the fiscal of the church, who was of blameless
life. His name was Sebastian Calelao. His sown rice had not sprouted on
account of the drought; but, in response to his prayers, God sent rain
so that his crop was saved. In Pilitan there was an Indian woman, named
Ysabel Pato, a faithful Christian. When she was about to receive the
viaticum, the priest found that the Lord had anticipated him. Other
marvels and instances of virtue have been exhibited among these
Indians.] Some Indian women accused themselves of having eaten
<i>buyos</i> on fast-days, but not on Fridays. When the confessor asked
them if they had fasted on other days than Friday&mdash;for the Indians
are not obliged to fast on the other days in Lent&mdash;they answered
that they fasted the whole of Lent, performing these fasts as works of
devotion; for the holy Apostolic See has <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb34" href="#pb34" name="pb34">34</a>]</span>excused them from this
fast, because of their weakness and the scantiness of their food. When
the religious thought that this was excessive, and told them that they
could not do so much, they answered that by the favor of God they could
do so, as they had already fasted during the whole of Lent on previous
occasions. The buyo is an aromatic leaf, shaped like an ivy-leaf, which
the Indians are accustomed to chew with a sort of wild acorn and a
little bit of lime. Even some of the Spaniards in this country very
commonly use it, though they do not swallow it, so that only the juice
reaches the stomach; it invigorates the stomach, and preserves the
teeth. To carry some buyos in their mouths, if there were not many of
them, would not break their fast; but in spite of all this, these
Indian women made a scruple of taking it in their fasts, out of pure
devotion and in an entirely voluntary way. [Visions of demons are
frequent among the Indians. One such happened in a part of this
province called Ytabes, of which the order took charge in 1604. The
Indian concerned had a vision of demons driven away by persons whom he
did not know, but who were clothed with white underneath and with black
cloaks. This was something which the Indian had never seen, because the
religious rarely wear their cloaks in the Indian villages, assuming
them only when they go into the pulpit to preach. At that time the
Christians there were so few that the sermons were not delivered from
the pulpit, but from a seat, the cloak not being put on for the
purpose. Frightful visions of the anito drove the father of Don
Francisco Tuliau to baptism. In Camalaniugan father Fray Gaspar Zarfate
drove out several demons who were tormenting Indian women.]

<h3 class="main">The great comfort which the religious commonly felt in
their ministry both in life and in death</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">[In spite of the sufferings of the religious in this
region&mdash;the heat, the strangeness, the homesickness, the poverty
of their life&mdash;they had great joy in their work. The aniteras, or
priestesses of the devil, who became Christians, often told them that
as soon as they came to heathen villages the devil left the houses in
which he was worshiped, which were wretched little hovels. They dreamed
that they saw their anitos in the form of carabaos, or buffaloes, and
of black men; and that they likewise suffered greatly at such times,
because the devil was so much their owner that he used to enter them
visibly&mdash;one of them, who was the mistress of the others, saying
that he entered her in the form of a shadow, and in that way gave his
oracles. The aniteras were, as the Indians said, beside themselves and
out of their minds at such times. Many miracles were wrought by the
fathers, and they had great joy in the marvels which the Lord showed
them in permitting them to save by holy baptism children and others who
were at the point of death, from eternal damnation. The bishop of Nueva
Segovia, Don Fray Diego de Soria, writing to his great friend, father
Fray Bernardo de Sancta Cathalina, or Navarro, on March 24, 1608, said
that when they had come from the province of Ylocos, they had been
detained in a port for two weeks by as heavy a storm as if they had
been in Segovia itself, and that they had suffered much on the road;
but that now they felt consoled by what they had found in the province,
which was a perfect picture of Pangasinan. He reported that in the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb36" href="#pb36" name=
"pb36">36</a>]</span>mountains of Fotol and Alamonag they had confirmed
more than six hundred Indians; and that even the little boys and girls
knew the definition of the sacrament of confirmation. He reports that
the religious of the province are very harmonious, especially those who
came from the college of Alcala, to which they purpose sending a golden
cup worth a thousand pesos, hoping that the college may pay for it with
missionaries, which will not be simony. He goes on to say that he had
been three days in the village, and that they had already confirmed
eight or nine thousand Indians. The cup of gold was sent, but never
reached its destination. His remarks with reference to the college of
Alcala are due to the fact that several of the religious who came over
on various expeditions had been supplied by that college. Among them
were some of the most devoted of the missionaries&mdash;for instance,
the bishop himself, father Fray Bernardo de Sancta Cathalina, and
father Fray Juan Cobo. The report of this father may well be followed
by that of father Fray Francisco de San Joseph, or Blancas,<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e393src" href="#xd21e393" name="xd21e393src">2</a>
who wrote from this province of Nueva Segovia to the father provincial,
father Fray Miguel de San Jacintho. His letter is given in full by
Aduarte; the substance of it is as follows: &ldquo;I have seen with my
own eyes something of what <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb37" href=
"#pb37" name="pb37">37</a>]</span>I have read in the letters of your
Reverence with regard to the great need of ministers here, and to the
desire of the people for them. We found the inhabitants kindly and
peaceful, and delighted to see us. When we disembarked at one of the
heathen villages on the way, some of the children ran to kiss our
scapulars. Some of the boys ran before us, reciting the prayers very
well, not because they had been taught, but because they had picked
them up from a couple of our boys whom they had seen several times. Yet
in spite of all this they will be lost and damned, for lack of friars.
The wife of the governor of this village was very ill; and desiring to
die a Christian, she had herself carried to the village of Pia, which
is a Christian village about a day&rsquo;s journey from hers. Father
Fray Pedro was at Pipig, a village near there, at the time, so that he
was in time to baptize her.&rdquo; In another letter to the same
provincial, he said: &ldquo;Your Reverence might see here this morning
a company of old men learning the doctrines of Christianity; another of
girls; another of married women; another of young boys&mdash;giving
praises to God like so many choirs of angels, proclaiming His doctrine
and learning it to prepare themselves for baptism.&rdquo; Father Fray
Jacintho de San Geronimo,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e401src" href=
"#xd21e401" name="xd21e401src">3</a> who is still living, writes a
letter to a friend of his in Nueva Espa&ntilde;a, which is dated on the
last day of the feast of the Resurrection, in 1607. It is substantially
as follows: &ldquo;I am at present in the province of Nueva Segovia, in
great happiness <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb38" href="#pb38" name=
"pb38">38</a>]</span>to see the desire of the people to become
Christians. Our poverty and disinterestedness have caused them to have
great confidence in us. I would not change my lot for any other in the
world, in spite of the hardness of our life here.&rdquo; The same
father wrote another letter to a friend in Manila, to the following
effect: &ldquo;There are more than four thousand souls in this village,
not the eighth part of whom are Christians, though all desire to become
so. On Holy Saturday three of us baptized six hundred persons.&rdquo;
The date of this letter was April 2, 1607. Although this father had
been but a short time in the province, he had already learned enough of
the language for such great results, and could rejoice in the fruit of
his labors. From all this it is plain that the missionaries in this
region who are busied with the ministry of souls have no need of
Espa&ntilde;a nor of anything Spanish for their comfort, except
companions to help them in the work. As there is no rule without an
exception, it must be so in this case; but if any missionary is unhappy
here, it is generally because he has failed in his obligations and
become lukewarm in his devotions. Those that can speak the language and
thereby convert souls are happy in their work; and those who cannot
learn the language should accordingly be unhappy. But the Lord is not
so poor as that, as will be sufficiently shown by a letter from father
Fray Garcia de Oroz, written from Nueva Segovia to a brother at Manila:
&ldquo;Though I have been told that I would be very unhappy and
discouraged by the difficulty of learning the language, and though I
find that it is very difficult to me because of my age and lack of
memory, I am not disconsolate; because merely to be in <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb39" href="#pb39" name="pb39">39</a>]</span>company
with a father who is a master of the language, and to act as his
confessor, will greatly serve our Lord. This region is a pleasant one,
and my health is good in it during the winter, which lasts from the
beginning of October to March. It resembles the climate of Valencia
during the same period, having cool and fresh nights. A great part of
the country is very open, and the mountains are not high or rugged.
Some of the convents are on the shore of the sea; others, on the bank
of a copious river, which is navigated by canoes for a distance of
sixty leguas up the river. No one has reached the head of it, or knows
where the spring is.&rdquo; The happiness of the missionaries in their
work will be plain from what has been said. As a result of having lived
devoted lives they died happy deaths, rejoicing in their firm hope that
they were going to enjoy the Lord whom they had served, and for whom
they had abandoned their parents, kinsmen, native lands, and the ease
which they might have enjoyed in Espa&ntilde;a.]</p>

<h3 class="main">The servant of God, Don Fray Domingo de
Sala&ccedil;ar, first bishop of the Philippinas</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">By the ships which came to these islands from Nueva
Espa&ntilde;a in 1596, arrived the sad news of the death of their
father and first bishop, Don Fray Domingo de Sala&ccedil;ar. This was
one of the greatest losses which they could have met with at that time,
for they lost in him a most loving father and a most faithful defender.
In their defense he had not hesitated to set out on a long and perilous
journey to Espa&ntilde;a, and that in his very last years, when his
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb40" href="#pb40" name=
"pb40">40</a>]</span>great age would have excused him from such
excessive labors. But the fervent love which he had for his sheep would
not permit him to offer any excuses, when he saw them in so great need
as they were in at that time. There was in these regions no place from
which he could obtain relief for them, nor could he have obtained
relief from Espa&ntilde;a if he had not gone there in person to get it,
for he had tried all other means. He had sent a procurator; and he had
written most urgent letters, and had learned by experience that they
did not bring about the results desired. In fine, these islands lost a
shepherd and a holy bishop; and when this has been said, everything has
been said. The Order of St. Dominic, which had been so recently
established in these islands, suffered the greatest loss in this
general affliction, for it had in him a father and a brother who loved
it most affectionately; and a continual benefactor, who, though he was
poor in the extreme, seemed rich and generous in the benefits which he
conferred upon the order. Without them it would have suffered much,
because the religious came as apostolic preachers, in the greatest
poverty, and in the greatest need of the favor which they always
received from this pious bishop. Don Fray Domingo de Salacar was born
in La Rioja in Castilla, and had assumed the habit in the distinguished
convent of San Estevan at Salamanca, where he was contemporary with
some who afterward became famous professors of theology in this
illustrious university&mdash;the father masters Fray Domingo
Ba&ntilde;es and Fray Bartholome de Medina [Fray Domingo de Salacar was
not inferior to them in scholarship, but his heart was set more on
sanctity than on learning; and hence he desired to go to the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb41" href="#pb41" name=
"pb41">41</a>]</span>province of Santiago de Mexico, which seemed to
have renewed the primitive austerity of the time of our father St.
Dominic. When he reached Mexico, though he wished to labor among the
Indians, the orders of his superior kept him from doing so, and he
became a teacher, and finally a master of theology, the highest degree
of this kind which can be reached in the order. His virtue was such
that during all the time while he was in Nueva Espa&ntilde;a (namely,
forty years), he never broke any of our sacred constitutions in any
point. As one of the popes has said, a religious who thus follows the
constitutions of our order, has done enough to be canonized. When the
directions of his superiors at last permitted him to give the reins to
his desire, he devoted himself to missionary work among the Indian
tribes in the province of Vaxac. He suffered deeply from every wrong
that the Spaniards did to the Indians; and his suffering was doubled
because he could not remedy their wrongs. However, he did what he could
for those that were under his charge by comforting them and encouraging
them to patience; and it is no small consolation for the unfortunate to
see that there is someone who pities them and sympathizes with their
suffering. So desirous was father Fray Domingo of laboring for the Lord
that he joined the expedition to Florida,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e423src" href="#xd21e423" name="xd21e423src">4</a> accompanying
the holy Fray Domingo de la Anunciacion in the hardships which he
endured, which he felt the more because he could not make the
conversions which he hoped for among <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb42" href="#pb42" name="pb42">42</a>]</span>those Indians. Before
beginning his journey, he asked the superior to bless all the waters of
the streams and rivers from which he should have to drink, that he
might not break the constitution which directs us not to drink without
permission and a blessing. The want of food from which they suffered
was such that they were obliged to boil the leather straps of their
helmets and of the other parts of their armor that they might have
something to keep them alive, or to delay death a little. When they had
exhausted this supply they ate roots and the bark of wild trees. On
this journey our Lady of the Rosary showed her favor to father Fray
Domingo by assisting him in a remarkable way on several occasions. Once
she enabled him to save the life of a poor soldier who had been
condemned to death, and once gave him grace to change the heart of a
man who intended to commit suicide. Although he desired to give himself
to work among the Indians, he was obliged by the orders of his
superiors and by his vow of obedience to assume several honorable posts
in the province of Mexico, becoming prior and vicar-provincial, and
finally the chief consultor of the Holy Office; but he gave up these
positions as soon as he could to devote himself to the work which he
preferred among the natives. He spent thirty-eight years in laboring
for those poor people, teaching them, and protecting them against
wrong. He was at one time sent to Espa&ntilde;a by his superiors on
matters of important business connected with the missions to the
Indians. Here he met many difficulties, as vested interests and great
wealth were arrayed against him; and on one occasion the nuncio of his
Holiness, to whom he had complained, commanded <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb43" href="#pb43" name="pb43">43</a>]</span>him not
to visit the palace. But, though he did not attain the end for which he
set out, he made a great impression upon his Majesty, who appointed him
first bishop of the Philippinas.] His Majesty felt a particular
affection for these islands, because their conversion had begun in his
time and as a result of his initiative. As they had received their name
from his, he desired also to give them a bishop with his own hand. He
chose a man whose learning, virtue, and deep zeal for the good and the
protection of the Indians qualified him to be the father and first
shepherd of regions so new and so remote from the presence of their
king. In such regions it is very easy for the wrongs which the powerful
do to the weak to be more and greater than in others; hence they needed
a valiant defender, and a strong pastor and master to contend with the
great difficulties which are always met with in new conquests. At first
father Fray Domingo did not venture to accept the bishopric, and
consulted learned and able religious. They all advised him to accept
it, as being a very heavy charge, but one in which he could do great
service to God and be of great advantage to the Indians. They suggested
that, if he were the bishop of the Indians, he could help them better
in the great sufferings which it might be expected that they would have
to endure, as all newly-conquered people have endured them. These
sufferings he saw and deplored when he went to his bishopric; and he
strove to remedy them as completely as he could. He accepted the
dignity for the labor and the banishment which it offered him, knowing
well that there was no honor and profit to be expected from it. At this
time he strove to bring with him religious of <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb44" href="#pb44" name="pb44">44</a>]</span>his own
order, feeling that they would be more closely allied to him and under
greater obligations to him; and that thus they would help him to carry
his burden. His Majesty granted them to him, and they reached
Mexico;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e433src" href="#xd21e433" name=
"xd21e433src">5</a> but here there were so many who died or fell ill
that he had left but one companion, father Fray Christobal de
Salvatierra&mdash;who was a wonderfully helpful associate, and aided
him greatly in the government of his bishopric, as well as in
everything else which had to be done; and these additional duties were
neither few nor pleasant. He went to the city of Manila and built in it
his cathedral church, assigning prebends and arranging everything
necessary for the service of the cathedral&mdash;although poorly,
because he had no ecclesiastical income, and because the royal income
in these islands was very small. He found his bishopric like sheep
without a shepherd, and strove to gather them together and bring them
to order; but, as they had learned to live without control, they took
his efforts very ill. Some of them broke bounds entirely, one of them
going so far that he dared to tell the bishop to his face that he would
better moderate his enthusiasm; for that if he did not, the speaker
could hit a mitre at fifty paces with his arquebus. But the good bishop
in these and similar cases followed the commands of St. Paul to his
disciple St. Timothy: <i lang="la">Argue, obsecra, increpa, in omni
patientia et doctrina</i>.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e442src" href=
"#xd21e442" name="xd21e442src">6</a> The good prelate put his
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb45" href="#pb45" name=
"pb45">45</a>]</span>shoulder and his breast to the wheel against all
these difficulties, and with all his heart strove to reform the morals
of the colony. By his example he animated the preachers and confessors
to tell the truth with greater clearness and courage than before; and,
that this might be the better and more effectively done, he called a
conference, or quasi-synod, composed of the superiors from all the
religious orders and of the learned men who were in the land, both
theologians and jurists. This conference sat for a long time. In it
there were also six captains who had had experience in that country,
and in the conquests which had been made there. These officers were
added to the conference that they might give information with regard to
many matters of fact upon which the determination of justice and
conscience in the case depended; and that the truth and righteousness
of the proceedings of the conference might be more apparent. It was
hoped that in this way the decisions of the conference would be better
received. In this assembly the holy bishop showed his great capacity,
his great knowledge and the clearness of his mind; and skilfully
directed and disposed of a great variety of matters which were there
very effectively decided. Many questions were there propounded and
settled; and from the decrees of the conference there resulted a sort
of general list or set of rules by which the confessors were to govern
themselves in assigning penance to all sorts of people in that country.
These rules affected the governor, the auditors, the royal officials,
the alcaldes, the corregidors, those who had taken part in the
conquest, the encomenderos, the collectors of tributes, and people of
all ranks&mdash;in a word, all the inhabitants of the
country<span class="corr" id="xd21e449" title="Not in source">.</span>
It had validity for what had <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb46" href=
"#pb46" name="pb46">46</a>]</span>been done as well as for what was to
come. This was a very helpful matter, because it dealt with affairs
which offered no precedents, did not regularly happen, and could not be
understood by everyone because of their great difficulty. On this
account those who understood them best, and desired to deal with them
as truth and reason required, were not respected by those who were most
concerned. The latter, in order that they might avoid their
obligations, ordinarily tried to find confessors who would show
leniency, to their own harm and to that of their penitents. But as soon
as these decrees appeared, having been voted by so many learned and
holy men, they were such that neither confessors nor penitents dared
oppose them. This conference was accordingly a very important one; and
in a few days it was possible to see the new light which had come to
these islands and to perceive how thoughtful and careful, and how full
of knowledge, was the new shepherd and spouse of this church. The holy
bishop afforded much edification with his teaching, his addresses, and
his sermons, for he was a learned theologian and an excellent preacher;
but he did very much more by the example of his admirable life. The
sermons which he preached in this way had great power over the souls of
those who looked upon this noble example, and even hardened hearts
could not resist them. He did not alter his habit, his bed, or his
diet. His habit was of serge, as was customary in Nueva Espa&ntilde;a.
He wore a woolen shirt, and slept upon a bed which was even poorer than
that of the poorest religious. His food was eggs and fish; his dwelling
had no paintings or adornments in it. He rose at midnight to recite
matins, and after this he offered <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb47"
href="#pb47" name="pb47">47</a>]</span>his mental prayer. That he might
not trouble anyone to give him a light, he always kept a tinder and
flint, and struck and kindled his own light without having any servant
to attend upon him when he went to bed or when he rose. He was
especially devoted to our Lady of the Rosary, whose grace and favor he
had many times experienced; and he desired to see this same devotion
well established in all. When he spoke upon this matter, he seemed to
surpass himself; and some believed that our Lady spoke in him, because
of the grandeur of the heavenly ideas which he uttered on this subject.
When our religious reached this country, he entertained them in his
dwelling, as has been said; and he kept and cherished them there for
many days, gave them extraordinary alms, and bought a site for their
convent. He helped very much in the building of the convent, without
ever feeling poor for this or for similar objects&mdash;though he was
really in extreme poverty on account of the smallness of the salary
which he received, without having any other source of income. Although
the salary was small, it never failed him when the poor required it, to
whom belonged everything that he acquired. Thus he was always consuming
his income, without ever lacking something to give.</p>

<h3 class="main">A more detailed account of the virtues of the servant
of God, Don Fray Domingo de Sala&ccedil;ar</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The conformity of the good bishop with the divine
will, and his desire to be approved before the pure eyes of that
heavenly Lord with whom he always desired most intimately to unite
himself, and the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb48" href="#pb48" name=
"pb48">48</a>]</span>knowledge that he could not attain this approval
without striving with all his heart to imitate His virtues, and by
means of them to acquire something of His likeness, made the bishop
endeavor constantly with great solicitude to attain these
virtues&mdash;although to attain them it was necessary for him to
strive manfully to conquer his own nature; in so far as it was opposed
to them; and to multiply, in order to attain this victory over himself,
penances and austerities, to the end that his nature might surrender
and be subjected. The virtue of patience, which is in all circumstances
very desirable, and no less difficult to acquire and maintain, was that
which the bishop most needed, for at every step occasions offered
themselves for the exercise of this virtue. Since he was by nature
wrathful and hot-tempered, and was always engaged in defending the
right, it cost him much to control himself and to be patient. However,
he had so restrained himself and so become lord of his nature, that he
did not permit it to display itself. This was not only in cases where
he had time for consideration and for preparation, but in those sudden
and unexpected accidents in which those who are wronged are accustomed
to lose control of themselves, if the virtue of patience is not well
rooted within their souls or has not reached perfection. He was often
obliged to hear many insulting words from soldiers who were angry
because he had interfered with their excesses; but he kept silent, and
walked on as if he had not heard them, attending to his business
without taking any account of things which did not belong to it. Since
the Indians suffered from the abuses which were inflicted upon them, he
went in one day to speak on their behalf to the governor <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb49" href="#pb49" name="pb49">49</a>]</span>who was
then in office. He was not permitted to proceed with his business
without hearing many insulting words from the governor, who even put
his hands upon his breast and gave him a push. The bishop did not
change countenance; and, following the counsel of St. Paul, who bids us
give place to wrath, he left the hall that he might not more inflame
the wrath of this man. After a while, when he thought it was time, he
went in again, and with great serenity of countenance and with
gentleness of heart and words, he said to him: &ldquo;Bend your knees,
because my heart does not permit me to leave you under so heavy a
condemnation;&rdquo; and he added: &ldquo;By virtue of a brief of the
Supreme Pontiff which I have for this purpose, I absolve you from the
most dreadful excommunication which you have incurred.&rdquo; When he
had done this, he went out again; and even commanded the cleric who
accompanied him not to reveal to anyone what had happened, under
penalty of excommunication. On another occasion another ecclesiastic
whom he rebuked said to him, very angrily: &ldquo;How badly you treat
me, though you know that I am better than you are.&rdquo; The bishop
answered, with great calmness, that he was delighted to have in his
bishopric so honorable a person. With this gentleness he suffered the
blows of those who exercised his patience, leaving his cause to God, as
God commands us. The Lord assumed the care of his cause, and rigorously
chastised those who spoke evil of him. Some people wrote letters
against him to Espa&ntilde;a; and, before the answer came back, they
were called upon to give their answer before the tribunal of God,
ending their lives in sudden and dreadful death. He took great pains to
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb50" href="#pb50" name=
"pb50">50</a>]</span>preserve his chastity and the purity with which he
was born, esteeming it highly like a precious jewel, and performing
many penances to defend it from the assaults of the enemies who hated
its beauty and ever strove to destroy it. Two priests have borne
witness that he was a virgin: father Fray Diego de Soria, late bishop
of Nueva Segovia, to whom he made a general confession in his old age,
at the time when he was about to embark on the last voyage which he
made to Espa&ntilde;a. The other priest was a clergyman to whom he had
confessed more than two hundred times, and who was well acquainted with
the state of his conscience. This priest confirmed his testimony with
an oath. In spite of this, the world is such that the chaste bishop
found it necessary to defend himself against accusations in regard to
this matter, and to bear testimony to the purity of his own conscience.
At a public celebration of the holy sacrifice of the mass, with the
divine sacrament in his hands, he affirmed, because necessity required
it, that he hoped this celestial food might be his eternal damnation if
he was conscious of any fault of such a kind. If those who spoke
against him in this matter had been only laymen, angry because they had
been corrected and forcibly drawn from such vices, and mad with
passion&mdash;for such persons will not forgive those who are most
holy&mdash;if this accusation had proceeded from such as these, it
would have been matter for sorrow, but would not have been intolerable;
but there were even some ecclesiastics who saw that the bishop took
great pains to seclude abandoned women, and who ventured to make
themselves defenders of these persons of disorderly life. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb51" href="#pb51" name="pb51">51</a>]</span>They
declared that a man who gathered in so many of these women of evil life
(some of them handsome), shut them up, and heard them at their trials,
would be sure to put out his hand and select those who pleased him.
This reached the ears of the bishop; and the vengeance which he took
was to commend them to the Lord in prayer with all his
heart&mdash;pitying them as being persons who were really worthy of
compassion; since, without comparison, the harm that one who speaks
evil does to himself is greater than the harm done to him who is
wronged. The Lord heard these pious prayers, and touched their hearts.
They acknowledged the evil that they had spoken, and very repentantly
came to beg his pardon, at the episcopal residence, in the presence of
those who lived there. The bishop received them with open arms and with
abundance of tears, and had them that day as companions at his table.
The vengeance which the saints desire to take upon their enemies is, to
have them repent for their faults when they become conscious of their
errors.</p>
<p>He was very compassionate, and felt the utmost pity for the
sufferings of his neighbor. Of this a marked example was given on the
voyage from Nueva Espa&ntilde;a to Manila. There were in the same ship
more than twenty Augustinian religious, and, while they were at sea,
their water gave out. This is one of the greatest hardships which may
be suffered on a voyage. The bishop took pity upon them; and, although
he had not enough to supply the necessity of so many, he preferred
suffering with the others to seeing them suffer while he was
comfortable. Accordingly he offered them the opportunity to drink
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb52" href="#pb52" name=
"pb52">52</a>]</span>from what he carried in his <i lang=
"es">martabana</i>, which is a large jar holding twenty
cantaros<a class="noteref" id="xd21e479src" href="#xd21e479" name=
"xd21e479src">7</a> of water. Their need would not permit them to
refuse what was thus offered them voluntarily; and, though they all
drank of it, the Lord was pleased that it should last until they landed
on the islands, as the servant of God had prayed. It is no new or rare
thing for the Lord to multiply food and drink, that it may not be
lacking to those who bring themselves to need out of pity. This same
virtue caused the bishop to watch over this municipality of Manila, by
taking care that in the houses of the fathers of the Society [of Jesus]
there should be religious to give instruction in profitable learning to
those who desired to study it. That this might be made permanent, and
that there might not be any failure in it, he brought it about that his
Majesty gave command that the religious should receive an allowance to
be spent upon the teachers. The answer of his Majesty is contained in
the royal decree given at Barcelona the eighth [<i>sic</i>] of fifteen
eighty-three. The document runs as follows: &ldquo;To the reverend
father in Christ, Fray Domingo de Salacar, bishop of the Philippinas
Islands. Three letters from you have been received from my Council,
etc. Considering the good report which you give of the great results
which have followed and which are likely to follow from the maintenance
of the Order of the Society of Jesus, and considering that to this end
it is necessary that the Society should receive from me what is needed
for the support of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb53" href="#pb53"
name="pb53">53</a>]</span>the religious who desire to teach and
instruct in Latinity, sciences and good morals, those who come to them,
I have, until some one shall come forward to undertake this business,
granted the decree enclosed. In pursuance of this decree, the president
of the Audiencia and you will together determine how this object may be
carried out,&rdquo; etc. From this same spirit of compassion arose the
benevolence which he displayed toward all the natives by building a
hospital in Manila in which sick Indians might be cared for. He gave so
much energy to this that he not only was the chief person who concerned
himself with it, but he gave the first and the chief contribution to
establish and endow it. At the very beginning of the hospital he did
something worthy of his virtue and prudence. The sick in this hospital
were cared for by religious of the order of the seraphic father St.
Francis, and particularly by a brother named Fray Juan Clemente. The
infirmity for which they were ordinarily treated was buboes, which are
very frequent on these poor Indians because they ordinarily have to
walk in the water in their grain-fields.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e493src" href="#xd21e493" name="xd21e493src">8</a> The brother had
much to suffer with the Indian men, and still more with the Indian
women, the care of whom was in general not very consonant with decency.
On this account, the religious determined to give up this duty, and
actually asked the bishop for permission to leave the hospital. The
bishop, who was well acquainted with the conscience of Fray Juan, and
who saw the reason for his unhappiness, encouraged and consoled him;
and exhorted him not to give up, on account of these temptations, the
good work and the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb54" href="#pb54"
name="pb54">54</a>]</span>service which he had begun there. He gave the
brother holy and devout reasons for this, and finally said: &ldquo;My
son Fray Juan, fast for three days in the week; give yourself a
discipline, and keep your hour of prayer. As for the rest, I will
charge myself with it, and will take the responsibility upon
myself.&rdquo; The result was marvelous, for, because of the good
advice which had been given him and the prayer which the bishop made
for him, Fray Juan found himself so much consoled and changed that he
no longer felt the least difficulty or disquiet in the world; and, as
if he had cast all these difficulties upon another person, he no longer
perceived them in himself. Yet before this he had found himself so much
oppressed by them that, in order not to fall, he had desired to flee.
In a case of this kind, to take flight is to conquer&mdash;but not so
nobly as when the Lord puts forth His hand that His servants may handle
such serpents as these without being harmed by them, which happened in
this case as the result of the prayer of His servant the bishop.</p>
<p>The many virtues which this servant of God possessed were higher in
degree as a result of the fire of charity which dwelt in his breast,
which, as a queen of all the rest, held the highest place in his soul
and governed all. He could not eat or drink in comfort without dividing
with the poor; and therefore every day he set aside a part of his food,
and, placing it on the corner of the table, said: &ldquo;You know for
whom this is&rdquo;&mdash;namely, the poor, as his servants understood.
This was given to them, and not only this, but other alms. That the
matter might be the better attended to, they kept, by order of the
bishop, a memorandum of the poor and needy of the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb55" href="#pb55" name="pb55">55</a>]</span>city. He
directed his servants that whenever the poor women who asked alms were
Spaniards, they should indicate the fact by saying, &ldquo;Here is a
lady that asks alms;&rdquo; if they were Indians or mestizas, they
should say, &ldquo;Here is a woman.&rdquo; In this way, without seeing
them, he would be able to tell their station, and to aid them
conformably thereto. Still, when he was told about some such matter, he
often went down with the servant; and, if it was the first time that
she came, he used to say to her: &ldquo;Come, good friend, what is the
matter now? Beware not to offend God, nor to be tricked by the devil
into doing any base act for need or for selfish interest. Trust in God,
who will aid you; and I for my part will assist with all my
heart.&rdquo; In order that she might see that these were not merely
good words, he used to give her some assistance and to write her name
with the rest, so that he might aid her with the care required by her
need, and by that of her children, if she had any. Every week he
visited the prisons and the hospitals, generally assigning Fridays for
that purpose. He encouraged and consoled the prisoners and the sick
with kindly words and with alms, according to the need of each one. The
money which he could get together from restitutions and confirmations
he kept with the greatest care, that not a real might be lost; and, as
if he were the most miserly man in the world, he took care of it for
the poor alone, without permitting the members of his household or
anyone else to take anything from the confirmations, as is customary.
He used to say that this belonged to the poor, and that it was not
proper that one who was not poor should share with them. From some of
these alms, and from what he could add from <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb56" href="#pb56" name="pb56">56</a>]</span>his own
poor income, he bought some lots near the Franciscan convent, and some
cattle, with which he established a stock-farm, and gave it for the
establishment of a hospital for the care of the natives. The hospital
was built and still exists, having been very greatly increased by the
care of the Franciscan fathers, who attend to it with the greatest
charity. To exalt the hospital still more, the bishop obtained for it a
liberal concession of plenary indulgence for the Sunday of
Lazarus,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e504src" href="#xd21e504" name=
"xd21e504src">9</a> as he did for the hospital of the Spaniards on Palm
Sunday. So great was his charity and his desire to do good to the poor
that once, when he was without money to give them, he sold his pectoral
cross, which was worth one thousand eight hundred pesos, and gave it to
them in alms. In the same way went his table silver; and his silver
pontifical ornaments were almost always in pawn. His steward used to
try to excuse himself when he was told to give alms, saying that he had
not the means. The bishop, calling him to one side, would say to him,
&ldquo;Tell me the truth; how much money have you?&rdquo; He commonly
said that there was not in the house more than eight reals for the
daily expense, and sometimes only four. The bishop then made him give
half of what he had, saying that it was sufficient good-fortune to have
some money in the house all the time, so long as the Lord would provide
more; and the Lord to whom he gave took care that he should never lack,
sending him what he needed for himself and for his poor from some
source from which he had never expected it. When he got it, he would
show it to the steward, or give it to him, and say: &ldquo;Trust in
God, father, and know <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb57" href="#pb57"
name="pb57">57</a>]</span>that even if you had given me all that you
had, the Lord would have sent us more.&rdquo; It was a common saying
among the people of his household that the Father of the poor provided
money miraculously, in order that the bishop might give them alms. A
person of rank was once obliged by necessity to ask alms from him. The
bishop was much grieved, as this person seemed to be an honorable one;
and he directed the steward to give him all the money there was in the
house. As he found no more than eight reals, the bishop gave this to
him, and asked the man to pardon him, saying that there was no more at
that time, but that, as soon as he had any, he would be sure to come to
his aid. The Lord did not delay assisting him who had not only given
alms from his superfluity, but had given all that he had for the
maintenance of himself and his household. For on that very night He
touched the heart of a man who had laid upon him for ten years the duty
of the restitution of four hundred pesos, and caused him, without
waiting till morning, to embark at night and to come from Cavite to
Manila; and in the morning he gave the money to the bishop without the
bishop&rsquo;s ever having spoken to him. The bishop had desired that
his penniless condition should be cared for wholly by the Lord, who was
called upon to relieve the urgent need of him who was in such need as a
result of aiding the poor. When the bishop saw himself suddenly
enriched with four hundred pesos, he gave thanks to the Lord, from
whose hand he had received them rather than from the hand of him who
had brought them hither. He instantly summoned the person to whom he
had given only one peso the day before, because he had no more, and
said to him: <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb58" href="#pb58" name=
"pb58">58</a>]</span>&ldquo;For the little which I have given you and
the much which you desired, the Lord has sent me some money. Take these
fifty pesos and give me that one which I gave you yesterday; for it is
that which attracted all this. Be sure that you spend well that which I
give you; and, when you shall see yourself in prosperity, take care to
be liberal to the poor.&rdquo; The good man promised this; and in a
short time God, in fulfilment of what the bishop had said to him, gave
him so much money that he brought four hundred pesos, and gave them to
the bishop to be distributed among the poor. The rest of what the
bishop had received he did not spend on his household, though it was so
poor; but published in the church that he had some money to distribute,
and summoned the poor to his residence. Among them he distributed it
(as he wished to) very quickly; and, showing them the eight-real piece
which he had given in the first place, he said to them with much
happiness and joy: &ldquo;Just this peso is for me, because it is that
which attracted so many.&rdquo; When the bishop was at his meal, having
with him at the table the first founders of this province, who had
recently come to the city, a man came to beg alms. The bishop gave him
a peso; and, as it seemed to the beggar too little, he showed it to the
bishop, and said that he had not given him as much as he needed. This
conduct appeared to those who were present bold, and even insolent; so
they told the bishop that he ought to send the man away, because he had
received sufficient alms, and that it was impossible at one time to
succor every necessity. The bishop agreed; but before long his heart
was moved to compassion at the thought that the poor man had gone away
dissatisfied; and, with his eyes <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb59"
href="#pb59" name="pb59">59</a>]</span>moist with tears, he said:
&ldquo;Call that poor fellow back again. His need must be very great,
because it has forced him to be importunate.&rdquo; The beggar came
back; and the bishop, augmenting the alms so that the beggar should be
contented, was contented himself, and sent him away with his blessing.
Once it happened that he went to bed with fifteen pesos, which, though
for persons of his dignity it was a mere nothing, for him who gave
everything to the poor it was great riches; and in the morning before
nine o&rsquo;clock he had not a penny, because the poor had taken it
all. He used to say: &ldquo;The riches of bishops are in caring for the
poor, who are their proper purses; and, so long as my money is not in
them, they will suppose that I have appropriated it.&rdquo; This did
not appear only in his words, but he was so certain of the truth of it
that he carried it out in practice; and it often resulted that he did
not have money for the ordinary expenses of his household. He was
obliged to set sail from Manila to Espa&ntilde;a on important business;
and one of the chief supplies which he ordered to be laid in was a
provision of chickens and of conserves&mdash;things which he never
tasted, and which were so foreign to his way of living that he ate
nothing but fish, as if he had been in the refectory of an extremely
austere convent. They got together three hundred chickens for him; but
before he had left port two hundred of them were gone; while with the
conserves and other things that he took he was all the time feasting
and making presents to the poor and needy, so that nobody could even
induce him to taste a chicken. [On the road from Mexico to San Juan de
Ulua, though very ill, he charitably undertook the ordination of some
candidates <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb60" href="#pb60" name=
"pb60">60</a>]</span>for the priesthood, who had been caught in a flood
on their way to be ordained at Jalapa.]</p>

<h3 class="main">The marvels wrought by our Lord for His servants while
in this life, and the happy death of the bishop.</h3>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">[It is not strange that the Lord should have honored
the virtues of the bishop by working many marvels through him. Many of
these have fallen into oblivion because he strove to keep them
concealed, and also because there has been no one to keep a record of
them. Several times his prayers have saved men in imminent danger of
death; among these was father Fray Miguel de Venavides, who fell
overboard on the voyage from Manila to Nueva Espa&ntilde;a.]</p>
<p>When he reached Espa&ntilde;a it is said that his Majesty at first
was vexed on account of his return, because his bishopric would need
him during his absence. But afterward, when he saw him, his Majesty was
greatly pleased with him, and carried out the wishes of the bishop in
regard to the principal matters which had brought him there. The income
of the church was greatly augmented, his Majesty bestowing upon him a
large gift, and greatly increasing the small income assigned for the
prebendaries. He succeeded in augmenting the number of prebends so that
the church might be better served. A single bishop was not sufficient
to attend to the confirmations and other episcopal acts in all the
islands, still less to watch over the conversion of so many provinces
as are contained in them, practically all of <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb61" href="#pb61" name="pb61">61</a>]</span>them
being at that time heathen. Hence the bishop succeeded in having his
bishopric divided among four prelates&mdash;an archbishop and three
suffragan bishops&mdash;and he marked out the limits of each bishopric.
He succeeded in gaining in Roma what he desired, and was himself
appointed archbishop. This promotion did not suffice to alter the
ordinary mode of life of this servant of God, and made no more change
in him than if he had never been promoted. It is even said that he did
not care to be informed or assured with regard to it; that as his soul
had other purposes and more elevated desires, he cared little for these
things. He was right in doing so, since he was soon to see how little
substance there is in them; for he was attacked by a severe infirmity
which, before the bulls for his archbishopric were despatched from
Roma, despatched him to heaven, ending his labors and commencing his
eternal rest. He had no need to make a will, for he distributed all
that he could get among the poor. In the hour of his death, he had no
more than six reals; and though he had a poor sister, he never gave her
a real, because of his helping those who were in greater need. This
came to the knowledge of his Majesty, and it pleased him so much that
he displayed his royal generosity toward her, as indeed our Lord does
command, who takes upon His own shoulders the obligations which His
disciples fail to fulfil because of their love for Him. [These facts
attracted great attention in the court, and the small estate of the
bishop of the Indias became famous. He was buried in his convent of San
Thomas at Madrid. The day before, the archbishop of Toledo had died,
Don Gaspar de Quiroga; he was cardinal, and the richest prelate in
Christendom. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb62" href="#pb62" name=
"pb62">62</a>]</span>As he was to be buried on that same day, the
counselors of the king did not know which funeral to attend; and his
Majesty directed that they should go to that of the poorest. His
epitaph states that he died December 4, 1594.]</p>

<h3 class="label">Chapter XLIV</h3>
<h3 class="main">Father Fray Christobal de Salvatierra, associate of
the first bishop of the Philippinas and governor of his bishopric.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">There was but a short space of time between the death
of the first bishop of this region of which we have just spoken, and
that of his associate and vicar-general, father Fray Christobal de
Salvatierra. The bishop, when he went to Espa&ntilde;a, had selected
him as governor of his bishopric&mdash;having by many years&rsquo;
acquaintance come to know that he was worthy, not only of this charge,
but of much greater ones, because of his great and well-established
virtue, his marked ability, singular prudence, watchful zeal for the
honor of God, indomitable spirit, and the other noble qualities which
he had found in father Fray Christobal. All these were necessary for
the duties of vicar-general and governor of this bishopric at such
times as these, which were so near to the first conquest of these
islands. Even though the conquest had continued for some time, the very
great difficulties encountered in their spiritual government will be
evident. It will be even better understood by any one who has any
knowledge of the conquests of the Indias; for though it did not involve
so many cruelties as others, it was still impossible to avoid many evil
deeds which wars always bring with them, however <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb63" href="#pb63" name="pb63">63</a>]</span>well
justified they may be. This is still more the case against poor
Indians, who cannot defend themselves, and sometimes who cannot even
complain of the wrongs that have been done to them, since these are
committed by those from whom their redress should proceed. Since there
had not been in the islands, before the coming of the first bishop and
his vicar-general, any bishop to govern them as their own prelate, the
two ecclesiastics found them abounding in vices which by inveterate
custom had put out such roots and obtained such strength that it was
not possible to destroy them without great difficulty and labor, much
vigilance, and a courageous spirit, in order to meet the thousand peril
which these duties brought with them at this time. God, who never fails
the government of His church, provided for these offices persons with
such endowments as were possessed by father Fray Christobal. He was a
son of the distinguished convent of San Esteban at Salamanca; and
showed that he was so, not only by words, which often perish on the
wind, but by works&mdash;and by noble works, which he had learned in
that so prominent school of virtue and letters. He left his convent,
intending to become one of the pioneers assembled by the bishop for
this province. The number of these, as has been stated, was thirty.
When they reached Nueva Espa&ntilde;a, many died and others fell sick.
The rest of them, daunted by the voyage which they had already taken,
and attracted by the agreeable climate of Mexico, remained there. The
good bishop was unable to persuade any of them to come to these regions
except father Fray Christobal, who, like an immovable column, was
always firm in his opposition to these temptations, never <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb64" href="#pb64" name=
"pb64">64</a>]</span>abandoned the company of the bishop, and remained
constantly at his side&mdash;not only in this tempest, in which all the
others fell away, but in all the other and greater tempests which
afterwards fell upon them. He was greatly aided in this by the
conformity that there was in the natures of the two men. They were both
grave and prudent, intrepid of soul in the performance of the right,
and fearful of everything that not only might be evil, but might even
seem so. Above all, they were of one mind in their efforts to attain
virtue&mdash;devout, chaste, charitable, religious; zealous for the
honor of God, in themselves and in others; and ready for this cause to
undergo hardships or dangers of any kind. Hence, though the dangers
through which they had gone had conquered all the others and
discouraged them, father Fray Christobal was always firm and faithful
to his promise; and he accomplished it by persevering with constancy in
that which he had begun, even until death. This he did to his own great
good and to that of his neighbors, serving the Lord not only as one
good religious, but as if he had been many. He was like another Aod
[<i>i.e.</i>, Ehud], working with both hands, and having spirit,
courage, and industry for every undertaking of importance that offered
itself. He carried on together the offices of vicar-general and of
missionary to Bataan, at a day&rsquo;s journey from Manila, where he
was obliged to reside. Withal, he filled the functions of these two
positions, which seemed incompatible, with such perfection and
vigilance, that he has left for each one of them eternal fame behind
him. As if this was but little in itself, whenever any military
expedition was undertaken he accompanied the soldiers, in the capacity
of chaplain, as if he had <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb65" href=
"#pb65" name="pb65">65</a>]</span>been the most unoccupied person in
the province. He gave his greatest energies to the office of
vicar-general, which he filled with the greatest justice and
watchfulness, and in which he offered a very edifying example. He was
greatly loved by the good and feared by the bad; for his only purposes
were to do good to all, to adjust their disputes, and to make
friendships, or to unmake them when they were bad. He defended and
protected the Indians, as being a race in the greatest need of defense
and protection. When it was necessary, he chastised them, but like a
loving father. Hence he was much loved by them, and was feared both by
them and the Spaniards&mdash;even by the Spaniards in official
positions, because, when there was a question as to making restitution
for the honor of God, he pardoned no one. The zeal which he displayed
in rooting out vices and scandalous sins was extraordinary. He never
hesitated at any labor in this cause, however great it might be; he
never feared any danger which appeared in the prosecution of his holy
purpose, not even the danger of death. He was at one time threatened
with death itself; for a desperate man entered his very room with the
purpose of taking his life, at a time when he was careless and not
expecting any such evil intention. But the Lord, to whom he left his
defense, protected him; and the malevolent man was unable to carry out
his purpose and to conquer the constancy of Fray Christobal. The latter
knew that whatsoever hardship or death befell him in this way would
surely be for his own greater glory; and hence, certain that no evil
could happen to him that was really an evil, he did his duty with
courage in opposing all the wicked, fearing no one, but feared by all.
This <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb66" href="#pb66" name=
"pb66">66</a>]</span>was the case not only when he was present in the
city or village where people were living scandalously, but even when he
was at a distance from them; because without any warning he would
appear, like a ray of light, in any place where he was needed. He would
be at night in the city, and in the morning ten or twelve leguas away,
following the track of those who were living in concubinage. When they
seemed to themselves to be most safe, he caught them <i lang="la">in
flagranti delicto</i>. He used to take out wicked women from any house,
no matter how prominent it was, and no matter to what insults he might
be exposed. Nothing of this kind daunted him, or held him back, or
harmed him; nay, it did him much good, for, armed with patience for any
wrong to himself, he was able to overcome any opposition to his holy
zeal, and came out always victorious and with the upper hand. He knew
the women of evil life so well that they were not able to escape him,
or to conceal themselves from him. The punishment which he gave them
was very appropriate, because he shut them up in a secure place and
forced them to work to earn their living; and this, on account of their
licentiousness and idleness, was the worst punishment that could be
inflicted upon them, while for the holy purposes of Fray Christoval, it
was the most efficacious remedy which could be applied. By being shut
up they were kept from the sins which were caused by their being at
large; while by their bodily labor they paid for something of what they
wasted in their idleness. Hence in the time of this father this
wretched class of people fled to the mountains, without daring to
appear in the city. The Spaniards feared and hesitated to do many
things <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb67" href="#pb67" name=
"pb67">67</a>]</span>which after his days began to be very common. All
of these actions of the father were accompanied by such prudence,
purity of life and manners, and by such love and such good works for
the people, that although at the time those who were blinded and
carried away by their passions suffered greatly, and were very angry
with the man who interfered with their vices, still afterwards, when
their minds became calmed, they could not fail to recognize the
goodness of father Fray Christobal. He even gained the hearts of these
people, and forced them to love and esteem them. Wherever he went, he
received information from the most honorable people of what needed a
remedy; and being sure that they were persons who would not deceive
him, he immediately applied the remedy, with the least possible cost to
the delinquents. He knew them all very well, and knew how to treat
them. Hence with some he used no more rigorous means than looking at
them, and letting them know that he was acquainted with their faults;
and this was enough to bring about their improvement, which was what he
purposed and desired. But when more severe measures were requisite, he
was not slow or hesitating in employing them. Accordingly he was very
useful to God in his office by attacking many sins and scandals, and by
preventing others (which is an act of higher prudence). For the
juridical acts which he performed as an ecclesiastical judge he
accepted no fees, and he moderated as much as possible the fees of the
officials of his jurisdiction. Since he understood the language of the
Indians, he had no need of an interpreter, a matter of great importance
and the means of avoiding much injury, deceit, and expense in the suits
of the Indians. Since their means <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb68"

to distort justice by bribing them, unless the activity of the judges
prevents this evil. Even when this does not happen, the expenses of
suitors are always very large. The vicar-general was desirous of
avoiding these expenses, and therefore employed no interpreter, as in
everything he took care that all might plead and gain their rights at
small expense. This is an evidence that the great fear which he caused
was not due to the fact that he was quarrelsome or litigious, but
because he was zealous for the honor of God and the good of the souls
that were in his care. So long as the bishop was in the islands, he had
some comfort and defense; but as soon as the bishop had gone to
Espa&ntilde;a the father, being the sole governor of the bishopric
(which at that time included all the islands), could not fail to suffer
from the great increase of his labors, and greatly feel the want of the
bishop&rsquo;s support. The thing to which he gave the greatest amount
of attention and in which he found the greatest difficulty, was the
prohibition to the Chinese heathen of the comedies that they performed,
and to Spanish men and women attendance on those comedies, on account
of the manner in which they were performed, which was full of
superstition and idolatry. Up to the time when our religious had come,
there was no one who understood their language and customs, so no one
paid any attention to this point. The Chinese felt sure that no one but
themselves could understand their comedies, and performed them as in
China, full of superstitions and idolatries. This was found out by
Father Juan Cobo when he had learned their language, letters, and
customs. He gave notice thereof to the vicar-general, who ordered
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb69" href="#pb69" name=
"pb69">69</a>]</span>the comedies to cease, as being superstitious. The
Chinese were greatly grieved, and so were the Spaniards&mdash;the
latter because, although they did not understand the comedies, they
enjoyed seeing them for the sake of the actions and representations
which the Chinese make in a very realistic way; and the Chinese,
because they are devoted to this kind of entertainment. So every one,
including the governor, was opposed to the vicar-general. He, because
he did not understand the evil in the thing, took the side of the
Chinese; but the vicar-general was certain that these comedies were an
offense to the Lord, as well for the reason stated as because they were
performed by night, and many other evil results used to follow. They
were attended at night by Spanish men and Spanish women and their
female servants, and by other Indian women&mdash;who, covered by the
dark cloak of night, did many things which ought not to be done in
Christian lands. But the vicar-general put his shoulder to the
difficulty, and commanded that no one, on pain of excommunication,
should go to see the comedies. Since the governor was of the opposite
opinion, there was no one who dared to publish the excommunications; so
the vicar-general himself went and fastened them on the church-doors,
accompanied only by his friars, since there was no one else who
ventured to accompany him. At last, although it cost him much and much
evil was said against him, he brought this evil practice to an end.
Since that time Spanish men, and many more Spanish women, do not go to
see these comedies; and no permission is given for their performance
until they are first looked over and approved by a religious who
understands the language, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb70" href=
"#pb70" name="pb70">70</a>]</span>and who sees that they are not
superstitious but are historical, or have plots which are not
idolatrous. This is what ought to be done in the realms of a Catholic
prince, although the comedies are performed by heathens and idolaters;
for as the latter are not permitted to perform their idolatries, they
ought not to be permitted to play superstitious comedies made in honor
of false gods, for such comedies are part of the idolatry, which is
forbidden to them. It would be supposed that father Fray Christobal,
being so busy and so usefully occupied, would have no time to attend to
anything else except to his position as governor and vicar-general of
this diocese. Yet this was not the case, but whenever the opportunity
was offered&mdash;as was not often, there being then so few whom he
could employ&mdash;he took advantage of it to leave his duties for the
time. Hence when the first Spaniards went to the pacification or
conquest of Nueva Segovia, he went as chaplain of the soldiers, and was
with them in all the conflicts which they had with the Japanese, which
conflicts have already been described. He was the first priest that
entered that country&mdash;as it were, to take possession of it for the
friars of his order, who afterward converted it to the law of God and
to His gospel. In the same way, when another expedition was made to
Maluco, he embarked as chaplain, purposing in both expeditions to do
the greater service to his king and lord by restraining the soldiers,
by his authority and by the respect which they had for him, from the
disorders which the inconsiderate are likely to be guilty of under such
circumstances as these. This same desire of being useful in all things
caused him to take charge of the district of Bataan, which, although
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb71" href="#pb71" name=
"pb71">71</a>]</span>it contained many Christians, had no minister and
no one to take pity upon them or to assume the charge of them. This
aroused great compassion in him; and though these Indians were a
day&rsquo;s journey by sea from Manila, where he was obliged to reside,
he assumed the ministry to them and cared for them with great
solicitude and love and with no less labor. [The situation of that
district made the labor of the ministry very great. Father Fray
Christobal went on foot through all the lakes and swamps, attending to
the needs of all the Indians, for whom the four religious who succeeded
him were scarcely able to do the work. He did all this labor in spite
of a painful ailment from which he suffered. Among the things which
afflicted him was the necessity of sleeping in his clothes for the
little time when he could repose. This is no small discomfort in so hot
a country. His love for the Indians was such that, although his labors
caused him this painful infirmity, he devoted himself to them up to the
time of the coming of the other missionaries; and even after they came
he used to take his holidays by visiting these Indians as his beloved
sons. He greatly assisted the first religious to learn who were and who
were not Christians, for the absence or loss of records had brought
everything into confusion. He was very charitable, especially to the
Indians. To the Spaniards he was a father and a master, assisting them
in all their necessities in peace and in war. He showed his zeal for
the honor of God and for the rooting out of vice in the very last hours
of his life, by writing to the governor, Don Luis Perez das
Mari&ntilde;as, the request that he would have a bad woman taken from a
captain&rsquo;s house which he indicated; and that he <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb72" href="#pb72" name="pb72">72</a>]</span>would
send three soldiers to arrest a cleric of whom the report was spread
that he was leading an evil life. The asthma from which he had so long
suffered finally brought his life to an end. He died in the hospital of
the Sangleys, in the midst of the brethren of his order.] He was
mourned by the whole country, and especially by the religious of all
the orders who were in it. All declared that there would never again
come to this region such a friar, such a governor of the diocese, such
a father of the poor, such a zealot for the honor of God, a man of such
gifts for everything. When he died, the need of him was exhibited by
the public way in which those vices which, so long as he lived, dared
not appear or lift up their heads, began to prevail in the country. He
received a solemn interment, attended by the ecclesiastical chapter and
by all the religious orders, to all of whom he had done many friendly
acts, and by all of whom he was therefore heartily beloved. At this
very day his fame is as much alive as if he had died but yesterday. He
appointed to be governors of the diocese, by the authority which he had
received therefor from the bishop (whose death was not yet known),
father Fray Alonso Ximenez, provincial of this province, and father
Fray Juan de San Pedro Martyr, or Maldonado. The ecclesiastical chapter
resisted; and although the nominees plainly had right on their side,
and the governor, Don Luis Perez das Mari&ntilde;as, offered to put
them in possession, they were unwilling to obtain the control of the
bishopric by lawsuits. They renounced or did not accept the
appointment, and left the government to the chapter, as something which
should not be sought or even <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb73" href=
"#pb73" name="pb73">73</a>]</span>received except as the result of
compulsion or sheer necessity, not for one&rsquo;s own advantage, but
for the common weal&mdash;which very seldom is attained when the entry
upon such offices is obtained by lawsuits.</p>

<h3 class="main">Father Fray Juan de Castro, one of the first founders
of this province</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">[When father Fray Juan de Chrisostomo went to Rome to
get the documents necessary for founding the new province, he carefully
looked in every one of the convents that he visited for men of the
devotion, prudence, and holiness which he regarded as necessary for a
firm establishment of the new province. In it the rule and the
constitutions were to be punctually observed, and the religious were
not to be contented with observing them as others do, for we all
profess to observe them as they were written. He purposed to make this
province one of such virtue that it should be not only holy in itself,
but should have power by the aid of the Lord to fix holiness and virtue
in the souls of persons so alienated from them as were these Indians,
who had always been in the service of the devil. Among those upon whom
father Fray Juan Chrisostomo turned his eyes was father Juan de Castro,
of the convent of Sancta Cathalina in Barcelona. He was from the city
of Burgos, and was the nephew of the other father, Fray Juan de Castro,
the provincial of this province. God always shows His power in His
saints; but to be superior among many saints, to shine with special
glory among shining stars, is a much more marvelous effect of the
divine grace. Such was father Fray Juan de Castro <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb74" href="#pb74" name="pb74">74</a>]</span>in this
convent, which of itself has the name of being a very religious one;
and father Fray Juan Chrisostomo selected him for the high end which he
designed. Christ our Lord did not need to seek for holy men. His divine
power was such that He could make apostles of great sinners, like St.
Matthew or St. Paul; but Father Juan Chrisostomo, being a man, was
obliged to choose, for the foundation of the province upon which he had
begun, persons whose holiness was already formed. In order to obtain
father Fray Juan de Castro, he caused the general of the order to
assign him by name to the new enterprise. In this way the convent of
Barcelona, much as they regretted losing Father Juan de Castro, were
obliged to let him go to the Philippinas. His uncle, having been
appointed to the leadership of this company, sent his nephew to the
most laborious, but most meritorious part of the work&mdash;namely, to
the province of Pangasinan. Father Fray Juan, to save the other fathers
from hardship, carried water from the river, brought and split the
wood, kindled and stirred the fire, and was, in a word, the servant of
the rest; he anticipated all the others in these works and labors, so
that the rest of the religious might not be wearied out, and that the
Indians might not be annoyed, or feel ill-will toward the preachers of
the gospel, by being forced, against their declared intention, to bring
what was necessary for the services of the church and of the poor
convent. He suffered the lack of food with special content and joy. He
took great care of the neatness and cleanliness of the church and the
altar. In spiritual things he distinguished himself as he did in these
material labors; yet his uncle did not appoint him to any place as
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb75" href="#pb75" name=
"pb75">75</a>]</span>superior, but gave him that which he most
delighted in, the position of the greatest labor and the lowest honor.
When the heaviest part of the duty in Pangasinan was over, the Lord
ordained that he should seek labor somewhere else. It was decided to
send an embassy to China after the death of the governor, Gomez Perez
das Mari&ntilde;as. He had been killed by some Chinese traitors, who
had afterwards made their escape with the galley, in which was the
royal standard, much good artillery, and other things of value. The
purpose of the embassy was to demand justice upon these traitors. On
account of father Fray Juan Cobo&rsquo;s success in the embassy to
Japan, it was decided to select religious of the same order for the
present embassy. Father Fray Luis Gandullo was accordingly chosen, and
named as his associate father Fray Juan de Castro. As secular
ambassador went Don Fernando de Castro, cousin of the governor who sent
the embassy, and nephew of the dead governor. A storm blew them out of
their course toward the province of Chincheo, to which they had
intended to go, and drove them to the province of Canton, one of the
thirteen into which the Chinese realm is divided. As the Chinese there
had had no dealings with the people of Manila, they did not receive the
ambassadors with the respect due their office, or with the kindness
which ought to be shown to men who had suffered so from the storms of
the sea. They were arrested on the charge of piracy, but, by giving two
hostages, they obtained somewhat better treatment. They were finally
permitted to go to Macan, and afterward proceeded to Chincheo, but
could not find a trace of the galley which they were looking for. The
traitors had not <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb76" href="#pb76" name=
"pb76">76</a>]</span>gone back to their own country, but to a
neighboring kingdom which was less civilized and had less justice. Some
of them, not expecting to be recognized, afterward ventured to go to
Malaca, and paid for their crime with death. At last the ambassadors
returned, without having obtained any of the results which were desired
from the embassy. The fathers, however, had at least carried the sweet
savor of the Christian religion to those regions. On the return
journey, they met with such a storm that the vessel was lost, and the
people aboard her had to save themselves by swimming. Father Fray Juan
de Castro was carried by a plank to the coast of Pangasinan, a
day&rsquo;s journey from the coast of Bolinao, where the wreck
occurred. The exposure brought on a severe illness. Father Fray Juan
was taken to Manila and died in the hospital of the Chinese, passing
away serenely and devoutly.]</p>

<h3 class="main">The journey made by the father provincial Fray Alonso
Ximenez to Camboxa</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">[After father Fray Alonso Ximenez had completed his
provincialate, he went to Camboxa to preach the gospel there.
Circumstances seemed to make this absolutely necessary. In 1595 there
came to the city of Manila as ambassadors from the king of Camboxa two
soldiers&mdash;a Portuguese, named Diego Velloso; and a Castilian, a
native of La Mancha, named Blas Ruiz de Fernan Goncales. The kingdom of
Camboxa is on the mainland, like China and like Spain. The king asked
the governor of Manila for soldiers to assist in the defense of his
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb77" href="#pb77" name=
"pb77">77</a>]</span>kingdom against the king of Siam, his neighbor;
and also for Dominican friars, to preach the law of God in his kingdom.
The people of Camboja have special knowledge of our order because of
some religious, from the India of Portugal, who lived there a long
time.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e591src" href="#xd21e591" name=
"xd21e591src">10</a> One of them, named Fray Silvestre, was so highly
esteemed by the king that he had him about his person continually. The
Portuguese, however, were unwilling to attempt the conversion of this
region, because they thought, and quite properly, that they could not
carry it on to advantage from India. The governor, in spite of the
small force of soldiers which he had, and the religious order, although
likewise they had but few laborers, decided to do what they could to
fulfil the wishes of the king. The order accordingly appointed the
father provincial, who was within a few months of the end of his term.
The governor gave him the title of ambassador, associating with him in
the embassy the commander of the forces, Captain Juan Xuarez Gallinato.
Great difficulty was found in providing an ecclesiastical companion for
the father provincial, as those who were at first suggested could not
be spared from their duties. Finally I was appointed, accepting this
duty in accordance with my vow of obedience. Three vessels were
prepared for the expedition, one of them of Spanish build, the other
two of the sort used in this country which are known as juncos. These
are large boats, and carry a <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb78" href=
"#pb78" name="pb78">78</a>]</span>great deal of freight; but they are
weakly built to meet the storms, and have very little rigging on their
masts, and accordingly are easily lost in bad weather. A hundred and
thirty soldiers were collected, most of them without permission of the
governor, who had given his license for only forty. There were also
some Japanese, who are too much given to rashness in war; and some
Indians of this country, who on occasions of honor are very good
auxiliaries. The leader of the expedition [<i>i.e.</i>, Gallinato]
commanded the frigate; Diego Velloso, the smaller junk, in which we
religious went; and Blas Ruiz de Fernan Gon&ccedil;alez, the larger,
which contained most of the forces.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e608src"
href="#xd21e608" name="xd21e608src">11</a> January 18, 1596, we set
sail from the harbor of Manila, badly equipped and worse accommodated,
as usually happens on such occasions. We went to the island of
Luban,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e618src" href="#xd21e618" name=
"xd21e618src">12</a> fourteen leguas from the fort, to finish our
preparations for the voyage, which, though it is but a short one (only
two hundred leguas in length), is across a treacherous sea; for the
best-fitted vessels often suffer severely upon it, much more so those
which are poorly equipped, as were ours. The frigate and the smaller
junk made port that night; but the larger junk was unable to enter, and
was not to be seen in the morning. We assumed, as was true, that it had
taken advantage of the favorable wind and proceeded with its journey.
We were, however, anxious; because it was not well <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb79" href="#pb79" name="pb79">79</a>]</span>supplied
with food or water, though it was better supplied than the other
vessels. Two days afterward, we set sail; but on a calm sea, and with
the wind fair, our mainmast snapped as if it had been made of candy. It
was all rotten; and we were left like a cart on the water, with nothing
but our foresail, and that very small. The flagship took us in tow and
we towed a small boat with four Chinese sailors, which was the cause of
no little trouble. We sailed in this way for eight days, the sea being
calm. One night at the end of this time, the boat cable broke. The
sailors that were in the boat called out for us to wait for them; and
the flagship hove to, and began to sound while we were waiting for the
boat. Finding bottom in forty brazas, they perceived that we were near
the country of Camboja. In order to reach port early on the following
day, they left us, thinking that in spite of the smallness of our sail
we could reach there on the same day. The result, however, was not as
was expected; for by bad navigation we had gone many leguas to leeward
of the port. To make our way back there we had to sail against the
wind. A storm arose soon after, and the flagship was obliged to run
before the wind; it made port in Malaca, more than two hundred leguas
to leeward of its destination, and was unable to return for three
months. Our vessel could not make sail against the sea, being entirely
unequipped, and good for nothing but to ask for the mercy of God. Under
these circumstances fell the night between the eighth and ninth of
February. We all supposed that this was the last of our days, and no
man expected to see the next morning. The force of the wind drove us
aground more than two leguas from shore; we had to cut <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb80" href="#pb80" name="pb80">80</a>]</span>away the
stump of the mainmast, which was still standing, and to throw into the
sea the rudder and everything there was in the ship. The boat, which
might have saved us, was swamped; and the sailors who were in it got
aboard the ship. The waves broke over the vessel, but could not sink it
because it was already fast aground.] I sat all that night in the waist
(for it was impossible to stand), confessing the Christians and
catechizing the heathen. I baptized twenty-two of them, feeling that
the great danger in which we were, authorized the act. When they had
all received the sacraments, I encouraged them to the work which was
necessary to keep us from perishing. Several times I went into the poop
to confess myself, and to receive the confession of the holy old man,
my provincial, who was there waiting for death&mdash;at the point of
which we now were, with the rope, as they say, about our necks. We
could do nothing but put up supplications and appeal from the justice
to the mercy of God, by whom sentence of death seemed to have been
issued upon us. It was, however, only a sentence of warning; and He
accepted our prayer for the time, giving us hope that with His aid we
might atone for our transgressions. The efficacy of God&rsquo;s mercy
we almost felt with our hands on this occasion; for death appeared to
be actually upon us, making execution upon the lives of those who were
there. We were somewhat encouraged by the hope of reaching the land
which was so near to us; but we did not know what it was, and what we
were to expect from it. If we had known, we would have preferred to die
in the sea; for our sufferings in this way would have been less than
those which we underwent by reaching the land. We were like
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb81" href="#pb81" name=
"pb81">81</a>]</span>those of whom Jeremiah speaks in his
<i>Lamentations</i>, for whom it would have been better to have the lot
of those who died with the sword at one stroke than of those whose
lives were brought to an end by hunger; for the latter died a prolonged
and painful death, being destroyed by the barrenness of the land. The
barrenness of this coast was such that it greatly exceeded that of
which Jeremiah speaks. It was such that no one would go to it, even to
escape death, unless, like us, he was not acquainted with it. Finally
those waves which were on their way to burst upon the shore pushed on
the ship, which was practically empty, and went along as if it had been
a dry stick. This was a result of the coming in of the tide, and when
the tide ebbed afterwards, we were left aground, a cannon-shot from the
sea; and we saw in the mud (of which all this coast is composed) the
track of the ship like a trench, for the force of the sea as it rose
had pushed it along, breaking a road in the very ground. On this same
day the tide came in again with such fury, because it was a
spring-tide, that it carried the ship up to the trees and even buffeted
it about there with such violence that we were obliged to disembark for
fear of perishing in it. When we were on shore, exploring parties went
off in various directions. After they had made an arduous march, they
brought back the news that it was a wilderness inhabited only by wild
beasts, without any trace of a river or a spring, at least near the
coast; and that the country within proved to be inaccessible because it
was overflowed and very thickly overgrown. This news made us feel that
the sea was less evil for us than such a land, and that the tortures
which we had endured were slight compared with <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb82" href="#pb82" name="pb82">82</a>]</span>those to
which we were exposed by this desired but unhappy landing. Since eating
and drinking are a necessary and a daily obligation, and as our supply
of food and drink was very small, while we were more than a hundred
persons, we put forth all our energies to search for some remedy. As
thirst was that from which we suffered most, we dug wells in the dryest
parts we found, and when we met water, it was more salty than that of
the sea. I declare, as one who has found out by experience, that the
very dew which appeared in the morning on the leaves of the wild trees
there, was salt. Hence since the land denied us the sustenance which we
required, we determined to return to the sea, which had at least
granted us our lives, and which now gave us greater hopes than the land
of being able to preserve them. For this it was necessary to help
ourselves by means of the unlucky ship which was stranded on the shore,
for it had remained there after the spring tide was over. It had no
masts, or sails, or rudder, or anything that could be used, because
between losing them and perishing there had been no choice. To supply
these, it was necessary to put our hands to the work, until it was
finished. The most necessary thing to be done to the ship was to cut it
down and fit it so that it would draw but little water, and might be
rowed along the coast. Our relief was to be sought on land, but he who
should find it had to seek for it by sea. We were not now planning for
conquests or embassies, but for getting water&mdash;for which we would
have given all that has been yielded by the hill of Potosi, if it had
been ours. We spent ten days in getting the ship ready. We cast
overboard all the upper works and a good part of the under <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb83" href="#pb83" name="pb83">83</a>]</span>works.
We fitted to it twelve oars. In this way it was like a badly made
galliot; rudder, masts, and sails we replaced by rowing. While some of
us were at this work, others went to explore the country, doing their
utmost in the search for water. Some of these came back very joyful,
with good news, saying that about four leguas up the coast from there a
great river ran up into the land; that where it flowed into the sea the
water was salt, but that it must be fresh above. They also said that
they had seen the footprints of men on the shore. The work was hurried
on in the hope of satisfying our thirst, which was increased by it, and
still more by the heat of that region; for we were in the most torrid
part of the torrid zone, and had practically no defense or covering
against the heat. The vessel, being of so light a draught, was easily
launched; and embarking in it all that we had left of provisions and
clothes, which was very little, we put forth one evening and entered
the bight of the river of which we have spoken, reaching its mouth in
the morning by hard rowing. We entered it with great delight, which was
increased by the sight of a hut on the bank not far from the ocean.
Though there was no one in it, we promised ourselves large towns when
we saw it, and even assured ourselves of certain news of our
companions, of whom as yet we knew nothing, nor they of us. But within
a few days we found out the deceit and lost our joy in it. After going
for three days up the river, we constantly found the water salt like
that of the sea, whose arm it was, and not a river. Upon its banks on
either side there was nothing but impassable undergrowth. At last we
reached a point from which we could not go further up, because the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb84" href="#pb84" name=
"pb84">84</a>]</span>seeming river divided into so many little creeks
that the ship had not room in any of them. The change from the false
hope of water and of towns, which had possessed our minds, served to
redouble our misery; since now, as it seemed to us, we had lost the
hope of relief by land or by sea. Our necessity had now reached such an
extreme that the food was distributed by ounces, and the drink almost
by drops&mdash;though the labor of rowing, each man in his turn (from
which no one was excused), was such as to require much food; and the
heat was so excessive that even if we had been in idleness we should
have needed much to drink. But at last, having confidence in the Father
of mercies&mdash;who, though He distresses, does not overwhelm; and,
though He chastises, does not slay&mdash;we returned to the sea by
which we had come. At sight of it we left the vessel, in order to rest
a little from the labor which we had endured to attain that for which
we were hoping; and I went on land with my four Chinese (with whom I
was very intimate), and had them build a little boat of four
planks&mdash;fastened together by some twigs, so to speak, for we had
no nails; and calked with clay, for we had no tow, or any other thing
better than the clay. This made a sort of canoe. If awkwardly handled,
it filled with water. But, such as it was, I had two of the soldiers
get into it&mdash;for if they kept close to shore they would run no
risk&mdash;and told them to go up to the hut that we had seen to
discover whether there were any people there; because perhaps they had
hidden themselves, from fear of our vessel, when they saw it on the way
up the river. They did so, and at nightfall they discovered two grown
Indians and a boy. They made their way up to them, little <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb85" href="#pb85" name="pb85">85</a>]</span>by
little; and when they got near them they found that they were asleep on
the shore, not expecting anything to happen to them. They caught the
Indians, and bound them. When the rest of us came by soon after in our
ship, they called out from the land, telling us what they had done. Our
joy was so great that to render thanks the holy old man and I sang a
<i lang="la">Te Deum laudamus</i>; and at this hour, which was
midnight, half a cuartillo [<i>i.e.</i>, pint] of water was served out
to the troops in token of joy. The soldiers came on board with their
captives, treating them gently and showing them all sorts of kindness.
It seemed to us that God had sent them to us as angels to guide us, as
He sent St. Raphael to Tobias. We began to put questions to them by an
interpreter, asking what country this was, what population it had; and
where they had come from, and where they ate and drank. They answered
that they were from Camboxa, and that the country along this coast, and
inland for many leguas, was uninhabited; and that to go to the towns we
should have to enter a large river and to sail up for eighty leguas.
They said that large vessels went up the river, and that it was many
leguas to windward of this place. They declared that they were natives
of that country, slaves of one of its chief lords; and that, because of
the ill treatment which they had received, they had fled from him, and
had come hither where no man had ever landed. They said that they ate
nothing except shell-fish, which they caught with their hands, and wild
cocoanuts, that grew there; and that they had no other water except
what fell from heaven. When it rained they caught what they could and
kept it in some large reeds to drink afterward. They said that two
years <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb86" href="#pb86" name=
"pb86">86</a>]</span>had passed since they had come there. The effect
of such sad news upon the hearts of men who had suffered as we had may
easily be imagined. They also told us that some days&rsquo; journey
further there was a port; but that, if we meant to go inland, where the
king was, it would be necessary to leave the vessel at the port,
because there was no river that entered inland. Since our desire was
only not to die of thirst, any means by which we could get water seemed
easy and light to us. We accordingly set out by sea in search of this
port, taking these Indians with us, not with the purpose of increasing
consumers when we had so little to consume, but to have guides. We went
along the coast, running up to it very often wherever we thought we saw
any signs of water, and sometimes digging wells, but always in vain,
for the land could not give what it did not have. On the day of St.
Matthew the Apostle, we discovered a high island in the sea, named
Pulonubi.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e648src" href="#xd21e648" name=
"xd21e648src">13</a> It was about six leguas from land. We laid our
course toward it in search of water, thinking that doubtless it would
have some, being high and mountainous, and having a sandy shore; but as
the equipment of the ship was fastened on with pins, as the saying is,
our rudder broke, when we had gone out a legua to sea. Being buffeted
by the slight sea which was running, we had to return to land, and even
to run aground, in order to mend the rudder. The Lord seemed to have
declared that He intended to bring death upon us, because the
sustenance necessary for our life was entirely consumed; for since we
had no <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb87" href="#pb87" name=
"pb87">87</a>]</span>water, we were not only without drink, but also
without food, our provision being rice, which cannot be eaten unless it
is boiled in water. For lack of water, some ate it parched, which dried
their entrails. Others ate it imperfectly boiled in the steam of salt
water, putting it in a little basket over a pot of this water on the
fire, so that by the steam thus sent out it might be softened. The
water was so salt that it made the rice like itself, and left it
uneatable. There were some who, even after this fine example of
cookery, drank sea-water, which increased the thirst they were so
impatiently desiring to remedy. Others distilled it over the fire and
got some fresh water, but very little, at the expense of much wood and
with the necessity of keeping up fire day and night, which dried them
more than the water that they got moistened them. All this taught us
the great need in which we live, with our life on a thread, and the
Lord many times threatening to cut it short. When we had mended the
rudder as well as we could at the time, we went on up the coast, being
disillusioned, so that we would not have thought of going out to sea
even if the ocean had been as smooth as milk. Three days later, the
twenty-seventh of February, which was Shrove Tuesday, we took our hands
from the oars and placed ourselves in those of God, despairing of life.
The remedy came to us as from God&rsquo;s own hand without our
expecting it, when we were overcome by labor, and dying of hunger and
thirst, and had given up ourselves to death. Thus it is most certain
that the Lord comes to the aid of him who calls upon Him when all
things created fail him&mdash;blessed be God&rsquo;s holy name. We had
reached such an extremity that of that sorry ration of water which
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb88" href="#pb88" name=
"pb88">88</a>]</span>we had now had about a month, and which was less
than half a cuartillo daily for each person, there was only enough for
two days. We were not now thinking of making any effort to find any,
but had our minds wholly turned to preparing ourselves for death, when
the Lord of life ordained that the waves of the sea should drive us
into a little inlet which the land formed there, where we went on shore
with the intention of never leaving the place, but of ending in it our
voyage and our lives. It happened that one of the Indians in the ship
went to bathe in the water, to relieve the great heat from which he
suffered, and somewhat to moderate the thirst which was destroying us.
He swam to land, and there right on the shore (which was muddy, like
all of that along which we had coasted), his feet sank in at the foot
of a wild palm-tree. Feeling that they had gone into water, he drew
them out, applied his lips to the hole which he had made, and found
that the water was fresh. The thirst from which he suffered not
permitting him to wait until it settled, he drank mud and water until
he was satisfied. He shouted to us to tell us what he had discovered,
but no one believed him. At last, the Indian persisting in his
affirmation, all hurried to the water to look upon this marvel, which
might be compared to that which God performed in drawing water from a
rock that His people might drink in the desert; for no less miraculous
appeared to us this fresh water in a marsh so near the ocean. We gave
God a thousand thanks, and rejoicing in the feast, we forgot the labor
and the fasting which we had undergone in the long vigil. We easily dug
a well, for the whole soil was muddy, and on the next morning we filled
all our casks with <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb89" href="#pb89"
name="pb89">89</a>]</span>the water, which had now settled. We set sail
to look for food, and even aspired to greater things. [In a few days we
reached the port, where there was a garrison of Indians against their
neighbors, the Siamese. All the news which we obtained about our
comrades, and about the country to which we had come, was bad. The
flagship had not been heard of, and the other ship was at Churdumuco,
which is a large town eight leguas from the port and eighty from the
sea.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e657src" href="#xd21e657" name=
"xd21e657src">14</a> We were told that the king who had sent for us
from Manila, and whose name was Langara, was not in the country; but
that his place in the kingdom had been taken by his chief vassal,
because of the following circumstances. The king of Sian had made war
against the king of Camboja, with eight hundred thousand men. This
number should not astonish anyone, because the kings could make war
almost at no expense, their vassals providing their own arms and food.
The king of Camboja did not dare to wait for so great a multitude of
enemies, and retreated up the river to another kingdom known as that of
the Laos. The king of Siam made himself master of the country, and
after burning it all returned to his own country, being harassed by
hunger, which made more war upon him than did the king his enemy. The
army being in disorder, one of the chiefs of Camboja, with those who
had retreated to the mountains (about thirty thousand men), attacked
his rearguard, thus obliging him to hasten his retreat. This chief,
having conquered him who had <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb90" href=
"#pb90" name="pb90">90</a>]</span>conquered his king, took possession
of the kingdom. The new king regarded those who had come at the request
of the previous king as allies of his enemy, and therefore as his own
enemies. This news alarmed us greatly, as we were without our comrades,
our commander-in-chief, and our ships. However, being obliged to
disembark, and to put ourselves into the hands of the rulers of the
country, we made an honest man of the thief, as the proverb goes, and
decided to send a soldier to him as an ambassador&mdash;offering to him
our aid and service, on the ground that we had come to help the king of
this country, and found no other king in it but him. The king received
him kindly, saying that he only held the kingdom as a regent, and that
he was ready to restore it to the lawful king when he should return. He
sent an order to the mandarin of the coast where we were, to provide us
with boats and carts. The soldier on his return met the Spaniards of
the other ship, and learned from them that all that the king had said
was false and that his purpose was to kill us at his ease. They advised
us to join them in their ship, dissimulating in regard to our affairs,
and keeping on our guard. The father provincial sent me ahead to
confess those in the ship, because it was Lent, and they had sent to
him to ask for a confessor. I was on foot and suffered much, although
some things that I saw on the journey afforded me some alleviation of
these hardships. I one day reached a village where there was a
monastery of religious of their sort, of whom there are many in this
kingdom. I went to it and talked to a venerable old man, who was as it
were the superior of it. He was seated on a little platform about a
palm&rsquo;s breadth in height, with a small mat <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb91" href="#pb91" name="pb91">91</a>]</span>on it,
and the others sat on the ground. Without saying anything, I sat down
next to the old man&mdash;at which they smiled, thinking that I had
done so because I did not understand the custom of the country, which
did not permit that. We both showed each other much courtesy by signs,
and I by using some words of their language which I knew, although,
because I did not put them together properly, they laughed much. They
gave me a collation of some fruits; and the sacristan immediately took
me to his temple, which was at some distance from the house. It had a
sort of cemetery about it, surrounded by some slightly raised stones
which divided it from the rest. The door to the temple was small, and
the temple itself was arched, round, and small. (Here follows a full
account of the appearance of the temple. Some description of their
prayers and of their religious customs is also given. Aduarte states,
upon the authority of the Portuguese religious, that these native monks
are vicious and licentious in the extreme.) I finally reached the ship
of our people, and on both sides we told each other what had
happened.]</p>

<h3 class="main">The wars which followed in the prosecution of this
embassy</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">[By the sufferings and danger which we had passed
through, the Lord had prepared us to endure those which were to follow.
To protect the ship, some of the men had encamped on a little sand
island in the middle of the river. On one bank was the town
(<i>i.e.</i>, Chordamuco) of the natives, near <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb92" href="#pb92" name="pb92">92</a>]</span>which
there were about two thousand Chinese, some settled here, others who
had recently come from China as traders, with their merchandise, in
five large vessels, which they kept in the river near the town. They
had controlled the natives, and resented the coming of the Spaniards,
thinking that the latter had come to disturb or take away the
superiority which they had. So they sought for an opportunity to
quarrel with them, seeing that the Spaniards were few and that they
were many. Whenever the men on the ship went to buy food on land, the
Chinese tried their patience by annoying them without any reason. By
orders of the captain, Blas Ruyz de Fernan Goncalez, they endured this
annoyance, though sorely against their will. The captain sent a message
to the king asking him to bring the Chinese to order. The king spoke
fair words, but did nothing. Finally, the anger of our men got beyond
their control. On the Sunday after Easter, when all had received
communion, three or four were in the town with the captain&rsquo;s
permission. One of them came back with his sword drawn, saying that the
Chinese had chased and abused them, and that they had not dared to
violate the captain&rsquo;s orders. The troops armed themselves, and,
breaking away from all restraints, went to take vengeance on the
Chinese. I went along to calm the Chinese, if I could, by speaking to
them in their language, which I understood. They were all armed with
their <i lang="es">catanas</i> (a sort of hanger), and <i lang=
"es">languinatas</i>, or long knives drawn to a point. I dared not put
myself in their hands, because I was told that they would be better
pleased to get me than anyone else. Soon after, sixty of our men in two
companies, with some of our Japanese and Indians, came ashore
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb93" href="#pb93" name=
"pb93">93</a>]</span>and instantly attacked the Chinese. As our bullets
took effect at such a distance that the latter could not attack our
troops hand to hand, the Chinese were routed; and our men followed,
killing them, until they had driven them out of the town. The natives
of the country took no part in the conflict on either side. I saved as
many lives as I could. The soldiers, seeing themselves masters of the
field, pursued the Chinese to their ships, into which the Spaniards
were able to shoot from the high banks. In this way they soon got
control of the ships, which was necessary, because with these large
ships they would easily have overcome our smaller vessel, and thus all
hope to escape from the anger of the king would have been taken away
from us. The king<a class="noteref" id="xd21e692src" href="#xd21e692"
name="xd21e692src">15</a> was in great wrath. To send a message to him,
and to carry a statement of the case, the father provincial, Fray
Alonso Ximenez, was chosen. He went accompanied by half of the forces,
the rest of us remaining in the ships. Several days were passed in
sending messages backwards and forwards, but the king would not receive
the ambassadors in person. It was plain that the king was planning to
take all our lives. The demands which he made would have put us
entirely in his power; and, when the father provincial asked permission
to return and discuss them with the rest of the forces, the king
refused permission for anyone to return except the father provincial
alone. The intention of the king was to wait for a rainy day, so that
our powder should be moistened and we be unable to use our arquebuses.
When the father provincial came back, he asked me if I would venture
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb94" href="#pb94" name=
"pb94">94</a>]</span>to go to the camp, confess the soldiers and
encourage them, and carry to the king our response declining to follow
his wishes. When I reached the forces near the palace of the king, we
did not consider the question of taking any answer to him, but
discussed two plans of escape. One was to withdraw in good order,
defending ourselves on the way; the other to attack the palace of the
king by night and strive to capture him, his son, or his wife, whom we
might use as hostages. Captain Diego Velloso declared that if we should
attack these Indians boldly they would retreat to the mountains, and
leave the field to us; but that if we should retreat they would all
attack us. He had had experience in this part of the world, and what he
said was confirmed by others, so that his plan was accepted. That night
I confessed the men and told them what under the circumstances it was
lawful for them to do, enjoining them to commit no unnecessary
violence, and to take no lives except in self-defense. The attack was
planned carefully, the troops being divided into a front and a rear
guard, and some of the soldiers being left with a barge in the river
near where we were encamped, with orders to capture two Indian boats as
soon as they should hear the noise of conflict, so that we could make
use of them in our retreat. I should have been glad to remain with the
barge in order to avoid being present at the conflict, which promised
to be sanguinary.] However, it seemed necessary for me to accompany the
rest, and, armed as they were, and wearing no part of my habit except
my scapular, I accompanied the troops who advanced against the palace.
We were immediately detected, but succeeded in reaching the royal
dwelling&mdash;which was built of wood, <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb95" href="#pb95" name="pb95">95</a>]</span>like the other houses in
the town, but was very large. We broke in the doors, but the people all
escaped through other doors; and thus, though we gained control of the
palace, it was empty and we had failed in our purpose. I restrained the
troops from burning the palace; but we lighted some bonfires, so that
we might see each other. One of these saved my life, for as an Indian
on an elephant was charging upon me and was already very close to me,
so that I looked around at hearing the noise, the beast fled in alarm,
being scared away by the fire. The Indians were not frightened by our
daring, as we had falsely imagined that they would be, but gathered in
a large square near the palace to face us. Everything, however, was
noise and confusion among them, surprised as they were, and there was
no less among us; for the number of our opponents was so much greater
than theirs that, if darkness had not protected us, they could have
buried us in handfuls of sand. [Like Joshua, I would have held back the
dawn if I could. At daylight we were all in disorder. When the Indians
could distinguish us from themselves and saw how few we were, they
began to rain arrows upon us, several being wounded, Captain Diego
Velloso having one leg pinned to another, so that he could not walk.
Our troops were in entire confusion, some calling out that we ought to
come to an understanding with the Indians, others finding fault with
the plan that we had followed, until God was pleased to give me courage
that I might give courage to the others, and I took upon myself the
office of captain. Our last day, as we expected it to be, was bright
and clear. A body of courageous Indians charged down the street at us,
and their captain <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb96" href="#pb96"
name="pb96">96</a>]</span>almost reached our line. I confess that I
wished to leap out upon him, not that I might kill him, but that I
might be the first to die, and not see the carnage which I
feared&mdash;or the worse than carnage, if we were taken alive. But
wisdom ruled me, and I ordered Captain Blas Ruiz to attack him with his
halberd; with one blow he thrust the Indian through, shield and body.
The death of their captain somewhat abated the courage of the rest. God
was pleased that one of our bullets should strike the king, who was in
the rear, unseen by us, animating his troops. We did not learn of this
for some days afterward, but we could see that the Indians attacked us
with less ardor. The Indians cut off our retreat to the barge, and we
were obliged to leave the soldiers who were with it and to make our
way, back by the road. As we marched along, we were obliged to defend
ourselves on all sides, and especially against the crowd of Indians
which followed in our rear. We could go but slowly, burdened as we were
with our arms, and being obliged to carry our wounded.] Two arrows
struck but did not wound me, one being caught by a coat of mail which I
wore, and the other by my shield. We suffered greatly from hunger and
thirst. When we came to some puddles with rain-water in them (which was
more mud than water), all drank of them, and when I came there, though
I was one of the last, I did the same; and though the best had already
been drunk, and the rest was mixed with mud, it tasted better to me
than any water that I ever drank in my life. Under all these
circumstances, we marched on this day, which was the twelfth of May,
four leguas by four o&rsquo;clock in the afternoon, [when we were
obliged to halt because <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb97" href=
"#pb97" name="pb97">97</a>]</span>we had reached the bank of a river.
The Indians and we ourselves supposed that we should never be able to
cross. Here some of our men urged that we ought to give ourselves up to
the Indians as slaves for life; others declared that we ought to attack
them, and force them to kill us. At nightfall, rain began; and the
Indians, supposing that our powder would be moistened, prepared to
attack us. I passed along the line, confessing some and encouraging
all, though I must admit I was in great fear myself lest before
midnight we should be cut into bits, that each one of our enemy might
have his piece, as is the custom of Indians when they are victorious.
The storm ceased before they dared to attack, but the river was still
before us. There were two fords, one narrow and deep; the other, wide
and shallow, and at about ten o&rsquo;clock at night I decided that we
ought to make the venture, and learn whether we were to live or die. We
chose the longer and shallower ford, marching as quietly as we could,
and leaving behind us a number of burning bits of the matches that we
used for firing our guns, tied on the bushes, in order to make the
Indians suppose that there was a large number of troops there. Our
retreat was covered by six courageous men with two arquebuses each.
When we entered the river, our vanguard, which was already in the
middle, began to retreat upon us, fearing the people who were on the
other bank, and their elephants, which they said they were driving into
the water. I succeeded in reanimating them, and they fired a volley
from the middle of the stream, where the water reached the beards of
many of them. The enemy fled, and our passage was impeded only by the
difficulty of dragging ourselves through the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb98" href="#pb98" name="pb98">98</a>]</span>mud. We
marched on for the rest of the night very slowly, with our clothes
sticking to our bodies. On the morrow we found some fruit-trees and
broke our fast of two nights and one day. We had great difficulty in
carrying our wounded. One of the men being left behind by all, I had to
carry him myself with his arms over my shoulders, for he was taller
than I, until, after his wound began to grow feverish, he was able to
walk a little himself. Not long before sunrise we reached the great
river in which the ships were, but at a distance of two leguas from us.
We put three of the wounded who were the hardest to carry into a little
boat there, and ordered them to row down the river and carry the news
of what had happened, and to direct the others to bring the ship near
the bank where we were. In the meantime we cut some trees and made a
breastwork; and when the Indians (who are not accustomed to attack by
night) prepared to make their last rush and overwhelm us, our ship came
up and, approaching the bank as closely as possible, played on the
Indians with some artillery, and fired at them with arquebuses. Under
this protection we succeeded in getting to the ship, being carried in
two boat-loads.]</p>

<h3 class="main">Our departure from the kingdom and the events which
happened during our return to Manila</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">[On the same day on which we reached the ships,
Captain Juan Xuarez Gallinato arrived. He was told of our experience
with the Chinese and with the Cambodians, and of the good-will
displayed in this kingdom for its conversion, and also for the temporal
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb99" href="#pb99" name=
"pb99">99</a>]</span>ends proposed in the service of his Majesty.
Captain Gallinato showed that he disbelieved much of what was told him,
and that what he did believe impressed him badly. In spite of all that
was done to persuade him to wait a few days, he was resolved to depart
immediately; so we sailed to Cochinchina for provisions. Here we were
at first very well received. Then Gallinato sent Captain Gregorio de
Vargas as ambassador to visit the king, and to ask him for the royal
standard, the galley, and the artillery, and the other things which had
been carried to that kingdom by the traitors who murdered Governor
Gomez Perez das Mari&ntilde;as. The king took this demand so ill that
he tried to kill the ambassador, who barely escaped with his life. The
king, partly because of his rage, and partly from fear that the news of
his treatment of the ambassador would be carried back by the Spaniards,
sent two fleets and a large land force to destroy us. We here got news
of the death of the tyrant who had ruled over the kingdom of Camboja
and of the plan of a number of loyal chiefs to reinstate the lawful
king with the assistance of the Spaniards, to whom they meant to offer
great rewards. The Spanish ships were just putting out to sea when the
Indians reached the shore with the purpose of giving them this
invitation. It was known that the kingdom of the Laos (to which the
king of Camboja had withdrawn) was very near that of Cochinchina; and
Captains Blas Ruyz and Diego Velloso asked permission to go by land and
find the king. Gallinato permitted them to do so, and I accompanied
them to the city of Sinoa, where a son of the king acted as viceroy.
Some Augustinian friars who were in that country begged father Fray
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb100" href="#pb100" name=
"pb100">100</a>]</span>Alonso Ximenez to go with them and celebrate the
feast of St. Augustine. During his absence, the rumor that the Indians
intended to murder us treacherously kept increasing; so that we all
went aboard, in order to be able to defend ourselves better. The time
for sailing to Manila had come, of which we had to take advantage
without waiting for either father Fray Alonso or the captain, because
we should otherwise have been obliged to winter there. On the third of
September, a multitude of people suddenly appeared on the hills, and a
fleet came sailing up into the cove where we were. There were many
galleys and small boats, and among them there were fifteen larger
two-masted vessels, fastened together three by three, with no one on
them but a steersman. These were loaded with wood and fagots, to set
fire to us; while, if we took refuge in the water, the people in the
small boats were ready to receive us. The men on the hills began to
shoot at us with their arquebuses, which they used skilfully, aiming
well, though they were slow in taking aim. The bullets, however, fell
short. Our two smaller vessels set sail, and by the aid of a light
breeze moved out into the middle of the bay. The ship in which I was
was larger; and, though we tried to do as the other boats did, the wind
was too light for us, and the fire-boats came upon us and gave us a
great deal of trouble. They came so near that from the top of our poop
we could see the steersmen, some of whom our men shot, while others
took refuge in some little boats which they towed. When the fire-boats
were left without anyone to steer them, they followed the current of
the water, and left us in peace. At this point father Fray Alonso
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb101" href="#pb101" name=
"pb101">101</a>]</span>Ximenez reached the shore. They took off his
habit and dragged him, with nothing on but his breeches, before the
viceroy, who had come as general of this enterprise. He told him to put
on his habit again, and talked of his ransom; but our captain was so
angry at their treachery that he sent back a very wrathful answer. Thus
father Fray Alonso Ximenez was left a prisoner, but was not ill
treated. He received permission to live with the Augustinian fathers,
and at last was permitted to go to Macan without being obliged to pay a
ransom. From there he came back to this country at the end of a year
and a half. On the next day we set sail for Manila. There are shoals in
the midst of this gulf running for eighty leguas directly across the
straight course for Manila; and to pass these shoals it was necessary
to round one of the two ends of the chain&mdash;one in latitude nine,
the other in latitude seventeen. The latter being nearer the direct
line, we governed our course by it; and the flagship, sailing well
against the wind, rounded it. The vessel in which I was, being a poor
sailer, went by the other end, but got out of its course. We were
becalmed one night, so near the coast of the Philippinas that the
people were already beginning to prepare their clothes for going on
shore. In the morning we found ourselves in the midst of reefs which
were not on the charts. To make our way out from them, we were obliged
to sail back on our course; and after we had made our way out the wind
was against us, and we were obliged to sail toward the country which we
had left. We decided to land at Malaca, that we might at least escape
with our persons, for we cared little <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb102" href="#pb102" name="pb102">102</a>]</span>for anything else.]
We reached an island named Pulotimon,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e720src" href="#xd21e720" name="xd21e720src">16</a> which is forty
leguas from Malaca. The Indians here told us that there were some
pirates in that sea; that they were anchored about five leguas off, and
that we should have to pass them. This news greatly disquieted us,
because our vessel did not sail well or answer the helm well, which is
the worst thing that can be in a sea-fight. But it was not possible to
escape this danger, because there was greater danger in every other
direction where we wished to go. So we continued our voyage and met
with the pirates, as they had told us. They had five ships, four of
them small, and one of them large, strong, and well equipped, and
provided with nettings. On these boats there were many little flags,
which, we were told, were tokens of the prizes that they had taken.
They were of a tribe called China-patan, descendants of Chinese who
have colonized the kingdom of Patan. They had learned this business [of
piracy], because it is easier than others; and they had now sailed out
to practice it. That we might not show fear, but might excite fear in
them, we passed close to their ships, with our flag flying and our drum
beating. They failed to see that our invitation was feigned, accepted
it, and, weighing their anchors, followed us all night, giving us chase
till morning. The small vessels surrounded us, and with the large one
attacked us. Their arms at close quarters were pikes and javelins with
points hardened in the fire [<i lang="es">tostadas</i>]. The arms which
they used at a distance were culverins and arquebuses. In <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb103" href="#pb103" name=
"pb103">103</a>]</span>using our arquebuses we did not waste a bullet,
for there were many on whom to employ them. [We were alarmed by the
explosion of a keg of powder, but fortunately only one man was killed.
I was standing alone on the poop, watching for the result of the fight;
and at first the enemy did not notice me, since the waist was full of
their pikemen. At last, one of them perceived me and flung a pike at
me, giving me a wound of three dedos in depth. I descended from the
poop; but, before I reached the deck, one of the fire-hardened lances
struck me in the right jaw, leaving its point and innumerable splinters
in the flesh. With my two hands upon my two wounds I went to confess
some wounded men who were in danger. At last when the enemies saw that
their prize cost them much, they left us and went away without our
being able to follow them, because our vessel was so unfit. We
afterward learned in Malaca that out of two hundred pirates (which was
their total number) more than half had been killed. Most of us were
wounded, and two or three died&mdash;besides two others, who were shot
by accident by their own friends. After we had escaped this danger we
came, two days later, upon a surprise which was equally great. In the
strait of Sincapura, by which we were obliged to pass, we found a fleet
of eighty large galleys, with heavy artillery amidships and along the
sides. This was the fleet of the king of Achen, who was going to do
what injury he could to the king of Jor [<i>i.e.</i>, Johor] to whom
belongs the country of that strait. The latter had sixteen galleys for
its defense, which were in the mouths of the rivers to prevent his
enemy from entering them. Malaca is between these two kingdoms.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb104" href="#pb104" name=
"pb104">104</a>]</span>There was at that time an agreement that neither
of these kings should be assisted with men, but only with provisions
and ammunition, one side receiving the one and the other the other, but
neither receiving both. We passed ourselves off to them as Portuguese;
and when they called upon us to enter their galleys we excused
ourselves, because of the aforesaid agreement, and went on in peace to
Malaca. I went to our convent, where the religious were surprised at my
coming, partly because it was the middle of November, when they did not
expect a vessel from any direction, and partly because they saw me in
so coarse a habit, very different from that which they wore. Besides
that, I was very dirty and very lean, and had my body and face all
bound up because of my wounds. Although my appearance was so strange,
they were so discreet (or I had better say so charitable) that, without
asking any questions they arranged to take care of me, called in the
surgeon, and brought me underwear and a habit after their fashion.
After I was cared for and clothed, they asked me whence I came and how
I had been brought there. I was charmed with the kindness which they
had shown me, and told of my wanderings and of the sufferings which I
had endured, by which they were greatly astonished. I remained there
for six months. My cure took three months, and from the wound in my
face every day two or three splinters were discharged, some larger and
others smaller, until at least a hundred had come out. Though the wound
closed, two remained within, which came out two years later, two dedos
below the wound. I was much inconvenienced during those three months,
because I could only open my mouth a little way; and hence <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb105" href="#pb105" name="pb105">105</a>]</span>it
was very painful for me to eat until, by exercise, my jaw came back to
its former usefulness. Of the soldiers who came with me, some went to
India and twelve to Camboxa, supposing that the rightful king was now
probably there. They found on the throne his son, who with a great army
given him by the king of the Laos, and with the captains of whom I have
spoken, had returned to his kingdom of Camboxa and pacified it. Here
they remained for a considerable time, though they were disappointed in
everything. I and the others returned to Manila. The voyage is one of
five hundred leguas, and it took us fifty days because of the many
calms.] One calm night, when there was no one at the helm, the
binnacle, or three-wicked candle which lights up the compass, fell down
from the quarterdeck; and the flame instantly burst out through a
hatchway which was over it, frightening all of us&mdash;for there is
nothing more dreadful at sea than fire, for everything in a ship is
like tinder. In this ship, although it was small, there were more than
three hundred slaves, men and women. All of them raised their cries to
heaven. The captain, whose duty it was to encourage them, immediately
fell on his knees to make his confession, as if things had already gone
beyond remedy, but I pushed him away a pace and a half, saying that it
was not time for that yet, and that he ought to look out for the fire
first. I am almost certain that if he had been permitted to confess to
me we should all have burned to death, because, however little our
safety might have been delayed by confessions, there would have been no
remedy afterwards. We put all the clothes there were there into the
water, to soak them, and then threw them down the hatchway, one
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb106" href="#pb106" name=
"pb106">106</a>]</span>on top of another. In this way God was pleased
that the fire should be put out; and we were left as much amazed by
this sudden and dangerous accident as people are who are waked out of
their sleep by a beam of light falling on them. We at last reached
Manila by St. John&rsquo;s day at the end of a year and a half of this
tedious and painful journeying. Soon after, father Fray Alonso Ximenez
arrived by way of Macan from Cochinchina, where he had remained a
prisoner. After all our hardships, afflictions, dangers, and wounds, we
brought back no other fruit but that of having suffered for the gospel.
Our only intention was to go to preach in that kingdom, having been
invited by its king, and influenced by his promises to that end. These
were great, though he was unable to fulfil them, since he had been
despoiled of his kingdom when we reached it, as has been said.</p>

<h3 class="main">The election as provincial of father Fray Bernardo de
Sancta Catharina or Navarro, and the churches which were incorporated
in the province<a id="xd21e743" name="xd21e743"></a></h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">On the fifteenth of June, 1596, the fathers assembled
in the convent of Manila to elect a provincial, because father Fray
Alonso Ximenez had finished his term. The definitors (who, as they
afterward were to confirm the provincial, were elected first) were:
father Fray Diego de Soria, second time prior of the said convent;
father Fray Bartholome de Nieva, a religious of very superior virtue,
as will be narrated in due time; father Fray Juan de Sancto Thomas, or
Ormaca; and father <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb107" href="#pb107"
name="pb107">107</a>]</span>Fray Juan Garcia&mdash;all persons of
conspicuous devotion to their religious duties, and of noble example.
Several times they cast votes for the provincial without result.
Because there were many who deserved the office, and because the votes
were divided among them, no one had the number necessary for election.
Those who had the largest number of votes were father Fray Diego de
Soria and father Fray Juan de Sancto Thomas. These same persons
endeavored to persuade everyone to vote for father Fray Bernardo de
Sancta Catharina, who was accordingly elected. The election was a very
satisfactory one, for, in addition to being a very holy man, he was
very wise and learned, and most devoted to the ministry and preaching
of the holy gospel&mdash;in which, and in patience, and in the
endurance of the most severe hardships which befell him for this cause,
no one ever surpassed him, and he surpassed many. During his time he
had seen the province greatly favored by the Lord, by a very great
spread of the Christian faith among the Indians who were under his
care. Many of them in the villages where there were religious were
baptized; and, where there were no religious, they were desirous and
eager to receive baptism. Accordingly, at this chapter not only were
new churches admitted which had been built in the towns where there
were already religious&mdash;as, among the Chinese, the church of San
Gabriel at Minondoc; and, in Bataan, the church in the village of
Samal, besides others&mdash;but it also seemed good to admit heathen
villages, although they had no religious, and there were none in the
province so that teachers could be provided for them. Yet in this way
they strove to comfort those who asked and <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb108" href="#pb108" name=
"pb108">108</a>]</span>desired them, and raised in them the hope that
in this way they would receive religious when they came from
Espa&ntilde;a. Thus were received the church of San Vicente of the
village of Buguey, afterward called Sancta Anna; Sancta Catarina of
Nasiping, afterward called San Miguel; and others like them&mdash;to
which, in the course of time, religious were sent when they came to the
islands.</p>
<p>Soon after this provincial chapter had come to an end, another
shipload of religious arrived from Espa&ntilde;a. They had been
gathered with great care and diligence by the new bishop of Nueva
Segovia, Don Fray Miguel de Venavides, whose new dignity had not
sufficed to diminish the love which he felt for his associates. He gave
to this matter more than ordinary attention, because he knew how
greatly needed were good workmen to aid in the great harvest which the
Lord had placed in their hands, ready to be gathered by the means of
baptism into this church militant, that the faithful might pass from it
to the church triumphant. The Indians themselves asked to have
preachers sent to their villages, and were grieved that these could not
be given to them. This not a little afflicted the religious, who
desired to satisfy them by the fulfilment of their just desires, but
were unable to do so on account of their own small number&mdash;too
small even for that which they had undertaken, and much more to go to
the aid of new regions. Besides this, the careful bishop was influenced
by the need of his own sheep; for nearly everything to which we
ministered fell within the bishopric of Nueva Segovia, which was under
his direction. Accordingly, taking advantage of his authority as a
bishop, and of the reputation which <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb109" href="#pb109" name="pb109">109</a>]</span>he had as a learned
and holy religious, he gathered the second shipload, and afterward the
third (with which he came). Father Fray Pedro de Ledesma<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e754src" href="#xd21e754" name="xd21e754src">17</a>
happened to be in Castilla when the shipload which the good bishop sent
was about to sail. His presence was very convenient for his superior,
because he was an old and venerable father who had been many years in
the Indias in the very religious province of Guatimala, and who
therefore knew what was needed for the voyage. He was also of a very
gentle disposition, which is of great importance for such purposes as
his. The bishop laid upon this father the charge of conducting the
religious who had been gathered for this province; and he, being
inclined to all good, readily accepted the office, although he knew
that it was a very troublesome one. It not only required him to go on
business to the office of accounts&mdash;and, to him who knows what
that is, it is not necessary to say anything more&mdash;but he had also
to keep in contentment many religious who, as it was the first time
when they were at sea, were seasick, miserable, and very much in need
of someone to comfort them, bear with them, and encourage them. For all
this father Fray Pedro was very well suited, and conducted them as
comfortably as possible through the two long voyages which have to be
made on the way from Espa&ntilde;a here. He did not shrink from the
great labor which this duty brought with it, that he might serve the
Lord, and aid in the preaching of His gospel and in the conversion of
these heathen. They arrived in the month of July <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb110" href="#pb110" name="pb110">110</a>]</span>in
this year of 1596, and were received with great joy; and with them
those missions which were in need of religious were strengthened.</p>
<p>Captains Blas Ruiz de Fernan Goncalez and Diego Velloso, who (as has
been stated in the preceding chapter) went from Cochinchina to the
kingdom of the Laos to look for the king of Camboja, met with success.
They found his son (for the king was already dead), and told him all
that the Spaniards had already done to help him, and how they had slain
the tyrant who had undertaken to establish himself in the kingdom and
had usurped it. They told him that they had come to seek him that they
might put him in quiet possession of his kingdom, and other things of
this kind, and roused his courage so that he put himself in their
hands. Depending upon them, he returned to Camboja with a tolerably
large army, which the king of the Laos gave him; and the Spaniards
fulfilled their word and established him in his royal throne and
palace, causing the largest and best part of the kingdom to be obedient
to him. The king in reward of services so faithful and useful gave them
lands and vassals in his kingdom. To Blas Ruiz he gave the province of
Tran; to Diego Velloso that of Bapano, with titles very honorable in
this kingdom. The two captains in their new favor did not forget God,
to whom they had so especial reasons to be thankful; or their natural
king and lord, from whom also they had received rewards. They informed
the king of Camboja of the great good that it would be to his kingdom
to know and reverence God by entering into His service through holy
baptism, and to have the king of Espa&ntilde;a for his friend. For the
first purpose, father <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb111" href=
"#pb111" name="pb111">111</a>]</span>Fray Alonso Ximenez and myself
were proposed. They urged the great devotion, virtue, and prudence of
the holy old man, and the many sufferings which we had both undergone
from favoring the king&rsquo;s own cause; and they said that, if he
sent to call us back, we would very readily come to preach the holy
gospel. As for the second purpose they said that he ought to send an
embassy to the governor of Manila; and, as a sign of the beginning of
this friendship, that he ought to ask for some soldiers, by whose aid
he might easily complete the pacification of his country. The king
assented to all this, and sent his embassy with letters to the
governor, telling him that his principal reason for asking for soldiers
was that his vassals might be baptized with greater certainty and less
difficulty. To father Fray Alonso Ximenez he wrote another letter, in
the language and characters which those people use, and sealed with his
royal seal, of a red color. In the Castilian language its tenor was as
follows: [&ldquo;Prauncar, king of Camboja, to father Fray Alonso
Ximenez of the Order of St. Dominic: Greeting. From what I have heard
from the captain Chofa Don Blas Ruiz of Castilla, and from the captain
Chofa Don Diego of Portugal, with regard to the conduct of father Fray
Alonso Ximenez when the Spaniards slew Anacaparan, I have conceived a
great affection for father Fray Alonso Ximenez. Now that I am in my
kingdom I beg father Fray Alonso Ximenez to come to it, and to bring
with him father Fray Diego. I promise to build them churches and
convents, and to give permission to all in my kingdom to become
Christians. Though I have shown the two chofas<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e763src" href="#xd21e763" name="xd21e763src">18</a> great
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb112" href="#pb112" name=
"pb112">112</a>]</span>favor and wish to keep them in my kingdom, they
are unwilling to stay, because there are no religious here.&rdquo; The
two captains wrote in the same strain to the fathers, begging them to
come and reunite this kingdom with the Church.</p>
<p>The governor of Manila saw how much could be done for the service of
the king by sending the soldiers for whom the king of Camboja asked;
but they were in such need of men and money that they could not well
meet his desires. For this reason, a knight of the Habit of Calatraba
who had been governor of these islands, by name Don Luis Perez das
Mari&ntilde;as, promised to pay the expenses of the expedition from his
own fortune. The enterprise thus being made possible, we two religious
of the order for whom the king of Camboja asked were obliged to go; and
with us some religious of the Order of St. Francis, who were much
beloved by Don Luis. There were equipped for the expedition two vessels
of Spanish build, of moderate tonnage, and a galleot. The preparations
were made (as preparations usually are made by the hand of servants of
the king) slowly and faultily, as was seen by the results. We did not
set out for some months, and our ships were so badly equipped and so
weak that they began to leak as soon as the voyage began&mdash;a
forewarning of the evils that we afterwards suffered, in which the poor
knight Don Luis was disappointed, while all of us who accompanied him
paid for the inadequacy of the preparation.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e773src" href="#xd21e773" name="xd21e773src">19</a> Since we were
so late, the pilots <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb113" href="#pb113"
name="pb113">113</a>]</span>decided to follow the course by the gulf of
Haynau to go round the shoals by the end in latitude seventeen, because
in that way the wind would be favorable; while if they rounded the end
in latitude nine, which was the regular course, the wind would be
adverse. They left Manila September 17 [1598], with one hundred and
fifty soldiers and sailors. In the flagship Don Luis, who went as
commander, took with him father Fray Alonso Ximenez and the two
Franciscan fathers. He directed me to go in the ship of the second in
command,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e784src" href="#xd21e784" name=
"xd21e784src">20</a> giving that officer orders to govern himself by my
advice. Within six days the vessels were scattered in the storm and
were all lost, no one knowing anything of the rest, and each one
supposing that the others were continuing their voyage in safety. The
galleot met with the best fortune, for, although damaged, it reached a
friendly port, was repaired, and continued its journey. The flagship
was obliged to cut away the mainmast, and sailing under its foresail,
ran aground in China on the eve of St. Francis. All who were on board
had to save themselves by swimming, and lost even their clothes. In the
ship of the second in command, in which I was, the mainmast broke close
to the deck, fortunately falling over the side so as not to injure the
vessel or to kill any of the men. The mizzenmast, being badly wedged,
began to topple, and had to be cut away. We sailed on under the
foresail, hoping to reach a port. But the fury of the tempest and the
force of the waves were such as to break the gudgeons of the rudder.
Some of our men flung themselves into the sea after it and brought it
back, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb114" href="#pb114" name=
"pb114">114</a>]</span>but it was lost again; and we steered the vessel
with two long spars fastened to the side of the boat with a cable. The
ship was so strained that the boards on the sides began to play up and
down like organ-keys; but we threw cables about her, and drew them taut
with arquebuses. Then the bow began to work loose, from the weight of
the foremast and bowsprit, and we were forced to bind it firmly with
cables to the poop. All that we could do against the storm and the wind
was like the strength of a child exerted to restrain the fury of a mad
bull. In fear of another storm, we took refuge upon an island which we
encountered, one of the group called the Babuyanes. We found a harbor,
ran the bow ashore, and dropped two anchors from the poop. We put the
ammunition and the provisions that we had on shore; and had hardly
begun to dry our clothes, on the eve of St. Francis, when the storm
broke upon us with such violence that it seemed to me to try to swallow
us. The ship was broken in pieces; but the keel, and the artillery
which was carried as ballast, being too heavy for the deck, were buried
in the sand. We protected ourselves from the storm&mdash;which lasted
two days, and was one of both wind and rain&mdash;in some huts, which
we built on the beach of branches.] After the storm was over we dug up
the artillery, which consisted of four medium-sized cannon, mounted,
and set them up in a little fort which we made of logs, because there
were many Indians on the islands, and we did not know whether they were
friends or enemies. In a short time many of them appeared in a troop on
the shore, with their weapons. These consisted of two lances, one for
hurling, and the other large like a pike, with iron points; both
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb115" href="#pb115" name=
"pb115">115</a>]</span>were made of ebony, of which there is much here.
For defensive armor they had sheets of the bark of trees, resembling
cork. We sent to them a man as a hostage and mark of peace, and they
made signs to him from a distance to put down his arms. He laid them at
one side and went to the Indians; and then they sent to us one of their
own number, whom we treated kindly, and after giving him some trinkets,
sent him back to his comrades; agreeing with him that they should bring
us provisions at a just price. They did this for two days, although
very scantily; and on the third day they broke the peace by killing one
of our Japanese, and badly wounding another who had come in our
company. He came back with his arm pierced, and with a wound a span
long above the pit of his stomach, but not entering it; but he was very
well satisfied because, by throwing himself forward by the pike, he had
killed the Indian who had wounded him&mdash;so proud is that race. Now
that our supplies were cut off, we were obliged, since food is
necessary, to take it by force, where we could find it, since they
would not sell it willingly; so for several mornings a troop of our
Indians went out under escort of our soldiers, gathered what they could
from the fields, and brought it back as food for all. At one time when
they were engaged in this, they thought that they had discovered a
great treasure; for they found some jars of moderate size covered by
others of similar size. Inside they found some dead bodies dried, and
nothing else. In that shipwreck we had had the good luck to bring the
boat ashore, and thus to save it. This we intended to make use of by
sending it to ask for aid from Nueva Segovia, which was only twenty
leguas distant. In order to <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb116" href=
"#pb116" name="pb116">116</a>]</span>do this, it was necessary to
lengthen the keel a braza, and to raise the sides about half a vara.
Both these things were done, though there was no one among us who
understood more carpentry than that best teacher, Necessity, had taught
them. We all thought that it was best that the pilot and two men and I
should go in it, because they believed that, if I went, more effectual
aid would be sent. We did so, and then, when we sailed around the
island we gave thanks to the Lord for His kindness in having brought us
to this little bay; for on any of the other sides of the island we
should certainly have been drowned in the ocean, or, if any of us had
escaped, should have perished at the hands of the Indians. The Lord
gave us a favorable wind, which was needed by our tiny boat in that
rough ocean, and we reached the river of Nueva Segovia, which is very
large; the distance from the mouth to the city is three leguas. The
alcalde-mayor immediately set about the rescue, appropriated two
fragatas, and had them prepared to go to our people who were in the
islands. At the same time I wrote to Manila to the agents of Don Luys
to send a ship, ship-stores, and everything else required for
continuing the voyage. I also wrote to my superior, giving him an
account of what had happened. The answer to my letters was made plain,
both on the island and in Manila. The governor commanded that the
voyage should be continued, all of the expenditure being made anew,
while my superior directed me to return to Manila; and so I did,
although my companions were greatly grieved. In truth, by failing to go
with them I caused their destruction; because, as they were sailing
toward the coast of China, they saw a Chinese ship, and, against
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb117" href="#pb117" name=
"pb117">117</a>]</span>the will of the pilot and some few others, the
rest determined to pursue and plunder it. The ship fled, turning toward
the coast of its own country, which was all sown with shallows, well
known to them but not to our men. So eagerly did the Spaniards chase
after them in their greed for the prize, which they now regarded as
certain, that our ship ran aground and broke into two parts. The men
were all thrown into the sea, where some of them were drowned
immediately, and others, who took refuge on shoals, were drowned when
the tide came in. Some few only escaped, with the pilot, in a raft
which they made of planks from the ship. Even of those few some died of
the cold, which was very great, and was still more severe for them
because they were all wet. At last those who escaped reached the coast,
with difficulty enough. They were seized by the Chinese, and carried
about for many leguas from one judge to another. In this way they
learned that Don Luis was on the same coast, and that he had been
wrecked on the same day of St. Francis, and at the same time with us.
They learned that he was twenty leguas from there, on an island called
Lampacao. They received permission to join him; and in spite of their
miseries they forgot their ills in their pity for the poor knight and
his men, who kept themselves alive with shellfish, which they found
there and ate in small quantities. They all suffered patiently, because
of the example of their commander&mdash;who, that he might not offend
[the people of] the land, never allowed his men to ask for anything,
even what necessity almost compelled them to request. <span class=

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">[In spite of the wretched state of the noble knight
Don Luis, the Portuguese of Macan, who were only seven leguas away,
were so far from pitying him that they rather made bloody war against
him. He accordingly decided to send the pilot of the second in command,
with eight other men, to Manila in a small boat, to ask for what was
needed to escape from that labyrinth. They arrived after great peril,
and delivered their letters which were filled with the innumerable
complaints of those who remained there. They moved all the city to
great compassion, but our religious more than the others, who always
had a very tender regard for the good knight, Don Luis, both for his
virtue, and for his great love toward us. He never forsook us or our
churches, where he received all the sacraments, and went to hear all
the masses that were said, to the great edification of the village of
Minondoc&mdash;where he lived, near to our house. Consequently, I was
charged with the immediate care of procuring what was needed for the
relief of the present trouble, since the past troubles had none. My
superior notified me that I should go to take the relief to Don Luis,
and ordered me to attend to that matter with the greatest possible
despatch, since delay meant manifest danger. With all that care he was
unable to get the help out within four months, and notwithstanding that
I exercised very great earnestness in it, and attended to the equipment
of the ship that was assigned, which I had fitted up so that it would
stand any storm&mdash;having taken <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb119"
href="#pb119" name="pb119">119</a>]</span>warning from the previous
ships, which had proved deficient in the first storm that came upon us.
By such diligence, we set sail, with suitable relief, on September six.
Arriving with it in less than twenty days, we were as well received, as
we were so heartily desired. We also found bad news from Camboja, which
had been brought by some ships that had returned from that country.
That news was that all the Spaniards there&mdash;both those of our
galliot, and all the others&mdash;had perished at the hands of the
Indians themselves, because of quarrelsome persons among them, who were
intolerable to the natives. Since it was impossible to go thither as
friends, and since our forces were very few to go in any other manner,
consequently, a general council having been held, it resulted that we
should return to Manila. To carry that into effect, it was necessary to
go to the court of the viceroy at Canton to get permission, for we
could not leave his port without it. It was determined that I should go
to get the permission. I was accompanied by two soldiers and an Indian
up a large river with most beautiful and refreshing banks, which
contained some very densely populated villages. Arrived at Canton, we
were lodged in a house in the suburbs, as foreigners were not allowed
to live in the city, nor even to enter it without express permission
from the judge who is in charge. Guards are stationed for that reason
at all the gates, so that they may refuse admittance without such
permission. It happened that there was a eunuch of the king there at
that time, as inspector of that province. Within his palace the king of
China is served only by eunuchs, and many are castrated, in order to be
eligible to serve the king; and as they alone have <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb120" href="#pb120" name=
"pb120">120</a>]</span>access to his person and ear, they persuade him
of whatever they wish, and derive immense bribes from the judges
throughout the kingdom. The latter give them the bribes, so that the
inspectors may hand in a good report of them. That year the eunuchs got
for themselves the inspection of the provinces of that kingdom, as a
great harvest was offered therefrom, not only to the king but also to
the others who remained at his side in order to perpetuate their acts
of injustice with security, the gates to the complaints that could have
been uttered against them having been closed. Then was it my unhappy
lot that I should fall into the hands of one of them, called Liculifu,
who had charge of the visit to Canton, and who, under pretext of the
visit, was making haste to impoverish the country and the inhabitants;
for his charge there also comprehended the inspection of a
pearl-fishery for the king in the gulf of Haynao, which was situated
about one hundred leguas farther along the coast. It was said that he
had borrowed one thousand ships for that purpose, and that he was in
haste; but that he wanted first what fish he could get on
land&mdash;for which he had innumerable parasites at his side who were
wont to seek out means by which, rightly or wrongly, he could employ
them, by which they were always the gainers; and who, in addition,
always flattered him by showing him such means of gain, by which he
considered himself as well served, and rewarded those most who were
most advantaged by it. Certain of those creatures, ferreting us out,
immediately went to denounce us, not as evildoers, but as men
absolutely rolling in silver; for that is their opinion of the
Spaniards, even though they see them going naked. Therefore, it
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb121" href="#pb121" name=
"pb121">121</a>]</span>suited him to employ his greed on us, although
asking silver from us was equivalent to asking pears from the elm tree.
The inspector, believing that we had maliciously concealed the silver,
tried to get it by force; but instead of silver he drew blood. Acting
upon that information he had us summoned before him, a day or two after
our arrival. We entered the gate used by foreigners, and there is only
one such gate. The guards registered us there, so carefully do they
watch and guard their city, although so rare are the foreigners who
enter it. We approached the inspector&rsquo;s court, but before we
entered it I had the inspector notified, by an interpreter whom I had
with me, that I would not kneel before him, as such was not the custom
of Castilians&mdash;whether religious or captains&mdash;even were it
before the kings of that land. He had me told that I should do so, but
I answered to the contrary twice more. However, finally paying greater
heed to the advantage that he expected [to derive], than to his honor
and courtesy which he claimed, he had me told that the soldiers should
kneel and that I should make him the bow and reverence that I was wont
to make to my king. Thereupon we entered, and found him seated in great
state at his desk, on which were the instruments used in writing,
according to their usage. Many servants stood near him, in a
chapel-like place that faced a large open court, whence those having
business entered as he summoned them. Placed on their knees between two
rows of executioners with frightful visages&mdash;twelve to the side,
who stood there&mdash;their cases were disposed of, and they were
punished there immediately, as soon as he ordered it, without further
appeal or recourse. The soldiers <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb122"
href="#pb122" name="pb122">122</a>]</span>and the interpreter knelt
before them, while I remained upright, after having made him a very
deep bow. He received us well, and addressed some pleasant words to us.
I thanked him heartily, and made him a present of a piece of scarlet
cloth and a large and excellent mirror, with its silver chain by which
to hang it up, which had been given me for that purpose by General Don
Luis. The latter already was aware that no business was transacted
without a present. The inspector received the present very gladly, as
it consisted of articles that were scarce in that country. He expressed
many scruples in regard to it, so that it might not appear that he was
receiving it as a bribe, and said that it would be taken as part
payment of the duties due and to be paid by the ships; and that he had
a conscience and kept his gaze on the heavens, so that he might not
commit any unjust act. But in truth, although I thought that he would
be satisfied with that present, he regarded it as the beginning of what
we had to give and waited for the rest. I asked him to send someone to
measure the ships and receive the duties, for it was now time for us to
leave. He did so immediately, and sent officials like himself. Those
officials declared, because they were not bribed at the beginning, that
the duties amounted to one thousand eight hundred ducados. Don Luis,
having been advised of what ought to be done, asked that the
measurements be made a second time; and after he had given them their
bribe, they took off the thousand ducados, and the duties remained at
only eight hundred. Believing that the inspector&rsquo;s greed was
satisfied, I delayed two or three days in going to see him; but he, as
his appetite had been whetted for the desire of more <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb123" href="#pb123" name="pb123">123</a>]</span>with
the taste that he had received, took my delay very ill, and had only
the two soldiers and the interpreter summoned, but ordered me not to go
to him. On seeing them, he broke out into great anger because they had
not treated him according to his dignity. He ordered the interpreter to
be beaten as the most guilty, since, knowing the custom of the country,
he had not advised us thereof. They actually administered five blows to
him, and the blows that they give are always few, but very severe.
Those blows accordingly formed great wounds on the upper part of his
legs, that being where they are administered. He ordered the soldiers
to be all but lashed. They were thrown to the ground, and their legs
bared, while the executioner stood near them with his lash raised. That
instrument is made from a very large bamboo (such as grow there), split
in two and weighted somewhat with lead, and having many slits, whose
edges cut like knives. And as the executioner stood thus, waiting for
the order to strike the blow, he ordered him to stay his hand, being
satisfied to see them thus fearful. Then he ordered all three to be
taken prisoners to a public prison, which was located at a considerable
distance from his house. While on the way thither they had me summoned,
and bribed the officials to stop in an idol temple. I went there alone,
although with great difficulty. They implored me again and again not to
leave them in custody, for they would die in prison. I promised them
not to leave that place until they were liberated, or else I would
share the same fortune with them. I well understood that those blows
were directed at me, rather than at them; and that, although given to
others, were a threat to me so that I should tremble <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb124" href="#pb124" name="pb124">124</a>]</span>and
give the inspector what he desired, or he would cause me also to suffer
such things, or even greater. I knew already that his parasites had
informed him of the esteem in which the Spanish hold their priests and
religious, and that they would redeem by weight of silver whatever
insult he might try to inflict on me; and that if he wished to fill his
hand well, he should make what extortions from me his tyrannous and
greedy taste dictated. I had no silver to satisfy his desire, nor, even
had I desired to supply that lack by any efforts, did I have any method
or means to do so. It even cost me very dearly to enter the city, and I
could not go on that account. I was persecuted by children, who
accosted me as did the children of Bethel the holy prophet Elisha;
while not one of the men had compassion on me, for they do not know
what compassion means toward their own countrymen, however afflicted
they see them to be. And further, if they behold them persecuted by the
more influential men, then in such case they flee from the sight of
them, in fear lest they receive a portion of the punishment, as being
accomplices in the guilt. The soldiers, as they were afflicted,
attributed the slowness of the relief to my neglect, and the inspector
to obstinacy. Finally he endeavored to satisfy his greed by making open
proof of my patience. Therefore, he summoned me on All Saints&rsquo;
day. I heard of his resolve some days beforehand, and prepared for it
by saying mass&mdash;for which I had the opportunity, as the Portuguese
from Macan happened to be there at that time, by virtue of their
ordinary permission to go to Canton twice each year, to purchase the
articles that they need in certain fairs which are held there at that
time. However, they <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb125" href="#pb125"
name="pb125">125</a>]</span>are not permitted to live in the city, but
must remain in their own boats in the river. As that purchasing (which
lasts many days) is a matter of consequence, the Portuguese bring a
priest, who says mass to them, in a little house near the river. At
that time there were three fathers of the Society there, one of whom
was acting in the capacity of chaplain for the traders, while the other
two were about to enter the interior with Father Matheo Riccio, who had
lived there for years. One of those two fathers, one Lacaro Catanio,
had lived with the above father for some years; and, having gone to
Macan on business, was then returning with another Spaniard named Diego
Pantoja. Both of them dressed themselves, on the afternoon of the eve
of All Saints, in Chinese habits, in order to make their journey with
some guides that they had with them. Father Lacaro Catanio, as he had
been a long time in China, had long hair and beard, but the other
father, having only recently arrived, did not; and consequently he was
in some danger, as he did not follow the customs of the country in
everything. By way, then, of those fathers I was enabled to say mass.
Scarcely had I concluded it, when I was accosted by an official of the
inspector, with his <i>chapa</i> (or summons) to take me before the
inspector. I went thither, and found him in his courtroom, as at the
first time. Although I intended to show him the same courtesy as the
first time, he made me kneel down, besides going between those two
files of executioners, who appeared to me like demons. The inspector
began then to shout at me, in his treble voice, and poured forth a
torrent of words, which were explained to me by a Chinese who
understood some Portuguese. He charged me in his speech with being
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb126" href="#pb126" name=
"pb126">126</a>]</span>a spy, as I had not observed my duty. At the end
of the speech came his deeds. At the inspector&rsquo;s order one of
those executioners threw me to the ground, and, baring my legs, raised
himself in a position to lash me. While in that position, the inspector
repeated many times his assertion that I must be a spy. Thereupon I
drew a report from my bosom that I brought from the Chinese who were
living in Manila, both Christians and heathens, which told of the great
good that the members of my order had done there to all of their
nation&mdash;how we cared for their sick, supported the poor, and
defended them all from injuries which were attempted against them. It
was written in their own characters, on a sheet of paper one braza
long, and was folded within a covering, also made of paper, after their
manner and custom. I had come prepared with that for whatever might
happen, and accordingly I presented it at that so pressing moment. The
inspector read it, while I was kept stretched out and bared ready for
the lash, and the executioner awaiting only the sign to chastise me. As
the letter was not to the inspector&rsquo;s liking, he paid no heed to
it. However, he did not carry out the execution [of the punishment],
but ordered me to rise and adjust my clothing and come to his desk. I
thought that it was to make peace, but it was only to vary the mode of
affliction by changing the torture, which he ordered to be given me
between the fingers, while placed on my knees before him with folded
hands. For that purpose some little rounded sticks were brought, in
which there were some small grooves at each end and in the middle.
Those sticks were placed between the fingers of both hands and were
then pressed together <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb127" href=
"#pb127" name="pb127">127</a>]</span>by some cords, tighter and tighter
as the inspector ordered&mdash;until, when I fell as if in a faint, he
ordered the torment to cease. He ordered me to be gone, and said that,
if I did not give him a thousand taes of silver on the morrow (each tae
being equivalent to ten reals, thus all amounting to about one thousand
ducados), he would kill me. I left his presence, with the bad treatment
that I have described, and went to my lodgings as best <span class=
"corr" id="xd21e826" title="Not in source">as</span> I could, where I
found an order from the inspector not to receive me. I knew not where
to go, for all fled from me, being fearful lest some blow should come
upon them by reason of me. I determined to go to the ship where the
fathers were. Then the merchants returned, much earlier than was their
custom, saying that all the city had risen against them, because I had
gone to their ship. They besought me not to do so evil an act, for they
feared a serious danger from that. As they refused to receive me, I
returned to the shore, where a Chinese trader who had been in Manila on
various occasions received me into his house. He got me the loan of one
hundred taes of silver, payable with interest; and that night I went
clad as a Chinese, so that I might not be recognized, to the Portuguese
ships. On my word&mdash;which I pledged on that of General Don Luis, in
whose cause I was acting&mdash;they lent me two hundred more. I sent
that whole sum to the inspector next day by my host, who was a man of
esteem in the city; I also had him ask that the inspector would be
satisfied with that amount, as I had borrowed it as an alms, and could
find no more, and that he would be pleased to liberate the prisoners,
and grant us permission to go to our ship. That was a just petition,
but it was ill received and worse <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb128"
href="#pb128" name="pb128">128</a>]</span>despatched; for although I
thought that that gift would soften that heart of stone, I discovered
that it had been like throwing a little water on the forge which blazes
all the fiercer. The inspector sent a constable with his chapa to
summon me that afternoon. It was necessary to go; and, thanks to my
host, who accompanied me, they took me to the entrance by another gate
of the city, as it was nearer his house. But when the guards saw me
they refused to allow me to enter, and although the constable showed
them the chapa of the inspector, they declared that that concerned me,
and not them; accordingly, they refused me entrance. It was necessary
for the constable to go to his master, and report the matter to him.
The latter gave another chapa for the gatekeepers, and they, taking it,
copied it and allowed me to enter. I did not find the inspector in his
court, but in a lodging nearer the center of the city. He was the only
one seated, while all his officials were standing. The money which I
had had sent to him was on a desk. I knelt down, at a considerable
distance from him, whereupon he began to chide me, and to say many
things to me that I did not understand. It seemed to me that he was
asking questions of me, and I only answered
<i>Purhiautet</i>&mdash;that is to say, &ldquo;I do not
understand.&rdquo; He rose from his chair, and came toward me, in order
to address me from a shorter distance. It seemed from his actions that
he meant to scratch out my eyes with his fingers (they are great men
for such deeds, the more when they are angry). He finally satisfied his
wrath by ordering me to be taken straight to the prison where the
soldiers were. An iron chain was therefore quickly put about my neck,
and fastened with a padlock; and <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb129"
href="#pb129" name="pb129">129</a>]</span>one of the executioners,
holding the end of it, walked before me, obliging me thus to follow him
as a captive. The prison was at a considerable distance, and was under
the orders of another mandarin, to whom he sent me, so that the latter
might incarcerate me. In such guise, I crossed all those streets, which
swarmed with people, at four o&rsquo;clock in the afternoon, and
appeared before this mandarin&mdash;who was in his tribunal, into which
the door of the prison opened. When the soldiers saw me through the
door, they began to weep. [I fell on my knees before him, and he asked
me through my interpreter the cause of my imprisonment. I replied, and
the cause seemed to him bad: but he told me that no one could undo what
the inspector did. He said that he would try to satisfy the inspector,
because the latter was obliged to go off very quickly on his
inspection, and, if he left me a prisoner here, no one else had the
authority to release me. With this he ordered the chains to be taken
off, and sent me into the prison. When I saw myself in prison with the
soldiers I was without anxiety, because for their sake I had made all
these stations,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e837src" href="#xd21e837"
name="xd21e837src">21</a> and after all without succeeding in rescuing
the prisoners&mdash;though I could have taken refuge in our ships if I
had chosen, as I afterwards did; while now, by adventuring the same
fortune with them, I left God to watch over all. There were in this
prison some three hundred prisoners, many condemned to death, but
permitted to work during the daytime in order to earn their food. I
suffered in the prison, because I had little protection and the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb130" href="#pb130" name=
"pb130">130</a>]</span>weather was very cold. God delivered me within
only three days; my host became my security for a thousand taes. As I
was about to leave the prison, all the servants crowded about me asking
for <i>plata</i> (silver), for they already knew its name in our
Castilian. There were so many that, even if I had had much to give,
there would have been little for each one. As I had nothing to give, I
gave them nothing, and they paid me with hard words and blows. It was
very late; and we were obliged to go to the house of the inspector, and
from it to that of the guarantor outside of the city, in which we were
not permitted to sleep. All this was to be done before they closed the
gates. We were kept waiting in the courtyard of the inspector for some
time. In addition to falling on our knees before him, he made us bow
our heads and then turned us over to our bondsman. When we reached the
latter&rsquo;s house, we had to enter by leaping over a lighted fire
which they said was the ceremony of security. The poor guarantor
immediately began to suffer persecution, for all the servants and
attendants of the inspector, though they had in no way intervened in
our business, came to beg money from him from that which they said he
must have received from me, to persuade him to become my security. The
man brought all these demands to me; but I answered him that nothing
more was to be paid than the thousand taes, and these we should get
from Don Luis. He was unwilling to go to Don Luis, and took great care
to prevent us from escaping. We, fearing that Don Luis and his soldiers
might be forced by our delay to leave us in this embarrassment,
determined to save ourselves. We <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb131"
href="#pb131" name="pb131">131</a>]</span>agreed with a Chinaman, for
ten taes to help us escape, letting us out through a secret door
opening upon a creek that flowed into the large river, and taking us
down in a boat. We sailed down stream that night and the next day, no
one appearing on the boat in the daytime except the Chinese sailors. We
succeeded in eluding all the vessels that might have wished to inspect
us, and reached our ships. As soon as our sailors received their pay
they ran away. A few hours later, my guarantor appeared with an armed
vessel. He was unable to find out who had helped us, and was satisfied
with receiving the amount of money for which he had been pledged. We
then set sail, Don Luis and the rest to Manila, and I to Macan, for I
was in such a condition of ill health as a result of hardship and
exposure that I did not dare to undertake the voyage to Manila. At this
time father Fray Alonso Ximenez died in Macan. His death was caused by
the hardships and exposure which he had undergone in endeavoring to
evangelize the kingdom of Camboja. Though he was almost seventy years
of age when he set out on the expedition, he endured everything that
befell him with patience and courage, consoling the others, though he
had always himself the most to suffer. He was very devout, never
omitting his daily hours of prayer on his journeys or voyages. When in
Cochinchina, his captivity was comforted by the opportunity given him
to convert two condemned criminals. The failures of his attempts to
reach the kingdom of Camboja and to convert the people there did not
discourage him or diminish his enthusiasm. When Don Luis and his men
were cruelly attacked <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb132" href=
"#pb132" name="pb132">132</a>]</span>by the Portuguese of Macan, father
Fray Alonso went to Macan to interpose his authority, and to act as
mediator between the Portuguese and the Castilians. Father Fray Alonso
had great difficulty in pacifying the Portuguese, and was obliged to
encounter much vituperation; but he received more joy in the baptism of
two sick persons at the point of death than he had lost in all the
sufferings which have been narrated. He died in our convent at Macan,
to the great sorrow of the religious about him at the loss of so holy
an associate. General Don Luis and all of the troops that he had
brought with him attributed to the loss of father Fray Alonso all the
sufferings which they were obliged to undergo afterward; while they
ascribed to his presence and his prayers the rescue of their ship in
the dreadful storm which they had experienced on the day of St.
Francis. On that day they had been in the midst of shoals, and had seen
many Chinese vessels wrecked about them; and the wind had been so
violent that it had thrown down many strongly-rooted trees on land.
Father Fray Alonso was a son of the convent of S. Esteban at Salamanca.
Desirous for the conversion of the Indians, he passed his youth in the
devout province of Guatemala. Having retired to his convent, to take up
the works of Mary after he had done those of Martha, he heard of the
foundation of the province of the Philippinas. When many were turned
back by the difficulties in Mexico, father Fray Alonso was always firm
and constant. When he reached Manila, the ministry of Batan fell to his
lot. In spite of his age, and the great difficulty which he had in
learning the Indian language, he at length <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb133" href="#pb133" name=
"pb133">133</a>]</span>succeeded. In this ministry he suffered the
hardships which have been described already. He was especially kind and
serviceable to sick Indians, preparing dishes of meat or eggs for them,
and even putting the food in their mouths, with his own hands. Being
taken severely ill as a result of all the hardships to which he was
exposed, he was carried to the convent of Manila. Scarcely did he feel
better, when he left his bed and began to work at the building of the
church, turning his hand to this manual labor with the greatest skill.
When he was elected prior, he had no assistance in the convent except
one priest and one lay brother; but, few as they were, they performed
all the offices of a community. As he had a sonorous voice and
understood music well, he would sing the whole mass alone; then leave
the choir to go to the pulpit and preach, and then return to the choir,
though he had been hearing confessions all the morning. This he did
without failing to make his regular daily prayer. Even when alone he
used to say matins aloud, and on some feast-days would sing a great
part of them. He was elected provincial from this office of prior; and
in his provincialate he made many excellent ordinances for the ministry
to the Indians, which are still observed and esteemed as if they had
been ordained yesterday. During his time the province was greatly
extended, the whole of the province of Nueva Segovia being admitted,
and many new churches and missions being established in that of
Pangasinan. It was his desire also that the kingdom of Camboxa should
be added to it; and in the glorious enterprise of extending the gospel
to that kingdom he ended his life.] <span class="pagenum">[<a id=

<h3 class="label">Chapter LI</h3>
<h3 class="main">The coming of some religious to the province, and the
transactions of the intermediate chapter</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Though the procurator whom this province had in
Espa&ntilde;a [<i>i.e.</i>, Benavides] had become bishop of Nueva
Segovia, he gave his main attention to the augmentation of the
province, having seen with his own eyes the service done by the
religious here to the Lord, and their service to their neighbors. So,
though he had sent off two shipments [of missionaries], he prepared to
send a third, whom he should accompany when he went to his bishopric.
So greatly had the hearts of the religious of all the provinces in
Espa&ntilde;a been moved that sixty were found gathered and assembled
together, having been designated by Father Juan Volante. They were all
far advanced in religion and letters, which are the excellences that
the order desires and strives for in its sons, that they may fulfil the
command of its institutes, by laboring not only for their own
salvation, but for that of others. It happened at this time that the
English found the city of Cadiz unguarded and unprepared, and sacked
it.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e866src" href="#xd21e866" name=
"xd21e866src">22</a> This aroused a great excitement in all the ports
of Andalucia; and the announcement was made that in that year there
would be no fleet for Nueva Espa&ntilde;a. Though all these religious
were at that time in or near Andalucia, they returned to their
provinces of Espa&ntilde;a and Aragon whence they had set out, with the
exception of some few who waited to see the end of this matter.
Although it was true that there was no fleet, a rumor <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb135" href="#pb135" name=
"pb135">135</a>]</span>spread that some ships were being fitted out for
the voyage. Hereupon the bishop&mdash;who had come on foot from Madrid,
but had been several days on the return journey because of the
misfortune which had happened&mdash;took courage and went to the port a
second time, reassembling the religious as well as he could. With
these, and with some others who offered themselves, he made up a
reasonable number. When they reached the port they found that the ships
which were about to sail were only some galizabras, with troops who
were going to guard the silver which came from Peru and Nueva
Espa&ntilde;a. It seemed that for a second time the purpose of the
bishop and the religious had been frustrated and their labor wasted;
but God sent them a patache or fragata, with only one deck, which was
to carry the baggage and the ship&rsquo;s stores; but it had no
accommodations for passengers, and was not designed to carry them,
because of its small size. In spite of this, their willingness to
suffer even greater evils for God made them despise the hardships which
they might suffer by making so long a voyage on so uncomfortable a
vessel, and they determined to sail in it. They spread the only
tarpaulin which there was, that they might have some defense from the
sun and the rain. They could not place it high enough for them to stand
under it, and whenever the sea was rough the waves dashed over it; but,
as there was no better ship, the bishop and the religious had to take
advantage of this one. The Lord felt such compassion for their
discomfort as to give them fair weather, so that during the sixty days
of their voyage it only rained twice: thus they were able to sleep on
deck, and at least to enjoy the coolness of night <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb136" href="#pb136" name="pb136">136</a>]</span>if
they could not avoid the heat of the day. During the voyage, they acted
as if they were in a very well-organized convent. The bishop filled the
place of reader; and upon what he read they held daily conferences, and
very frequent sermons and spiritual discourses. On the great feasts
they had, as it were, literary contests, composing verses in praise of
God and of His saints. Being thus very well occupied, they felt the
discomfort of the ship less; and as a result of the fair weather they
were all cheerful. The bishop alone was silent&mdash;so much so that
his religious became anxious, and felt obliged to ask him the reason.
He answered: &ldquo;I am afraid, fathers, that the Lord does not look
upon us as His own, so much happiness does He grant us in so cramped a
ship. Such fair weather, and not more than one religious sick; we are
not what we ought to be, for the Lord has sent us no hardships. My
coming was sufficient to prevent you from receiving that
blessing.&rdquo; When they reached Mexico, he planned to buy a house
where the religious who came to this province from that of
Espa&ntilde;a might be cared for. He wished to avoid scattering them
among the towns, the evil results of which had already been learned by
experience. He found someone to make a gift of a piece of land suited
for the purpose, with the obligation of building a church upon it named
for St. Just and Pastor. The writings were already made out; but
afterward, because of difficulties which arose, the agreement went no
further and had to be given up.</p>
<p>The voyage which they made from Acapulco to Manila was very
prosperous. The religious having been divided between the two ships,
those who embarked in the flagship, called &ldquo;Rosario,&rdquo; were
unable <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb137" href="#pb137" name=
"pb137">137</a>]</span>to get their ship-stores on board because of the
great hurry of the commander, Don Fernando de Castro. But God provided
for them from the ocean; for every day without exception they fished
from that ship, and thus the food of the religious was supplied. This
is something which never happened before or since that voyage to any
ship. Being so extraordinary, it caused astonishment, and gave reason
for reflecting upon and praising the divine Providence, which with so
free a hand comes to the aid of those who depend upon it in their need.
The intermediate provincial chapter was in session when the bishop and
the religious reached Manila; and thus they were received joyfully and
gladly, and the meeting was enriched by their presence. Religious were
assigned to the conversion of villages which, though they had been
admitted for their own comfort and for the sake of somewhat encouraging
the holy desires with which they so eagerly begged for missionaries,
could not hitherto obtain them, because of the lack of missionaries to
send. In the convent of Manila a regular school of theology and arts
was established. The chapter appointed as preacher-general father Fray
Diego de Soria in place of father Fray Miguel de Venavides, who had
hitherto held this place and had now become bishop. Because of the
small number of religious and of convents up to this time, it had been
customary that some should be designated from the distant provinces to
come and vote in the provincial chapters, although they were not
superiors. Now, however, as there was a sufficient number of convents
and of superiors, vicariates were designated, the vicars of which were
to be in the place of priors. These and <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb138" href="#pb138" name="pb138">138</a>]</span>no others were now to
have a vote in the provincial chapter, in conformity with the
constitutions and privileges of the provinces of the Indias. It was
also ordained that the confirmation of the newly-elected provincial
should belong to the eldest definitor, according to the privilege of
Nueva Espa&ntilde;a, which is likewise that of this province. At this
chapter there were received: in Nueva Segovia the village of Dumon, the
church of which at that time was called San Antonino; the villages of
Gatarang and Talapa, with the church of Sancta Catalina; and the
village on the estuary of Lobo, the church of which was San Raymundo.
The title of vicariate was given to San Pablo of Pilitan in
Yrraya.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e882src" href="#xd21e882" name=
"xd21e882src">23</a> In this place it seemed that another climate had
been found, different from that of the rest of this province, other
fields and spacious meadows, another temperature, and another race of
people. The country is very fertile, and abounds in game. It is very
well watered, very pleasant and very healthful, although at first it
did not seem so for the religious. The first vicar straightway died,
and those whom he took as associates were afflicted with severe
illness. For this reason and because of the distance from the other
convents, it seemed to many that it would be best to abandon it; but
the desire prevailed to go to the aid of those souls, though at the
cost of health and life, since on no occasion could these be better
offered. [The devil greatly resented their coming, and complained
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb139" href="#pb139" name=
"pb139">139</a>]</span>and uttered frightful howlings through the
mouths of his priestesses or aniteras. The coming of the missionaries
and the building of churches forced him to show himself in his true
light to his deluded followers. He often appeared to them in dreams,
bidding them resist and not become Christians. When they reminded him
that he did not resist, he answered that he could not endure the sight
of &ldquo;those barbarians with white teeth.&rdquo; He called the
religious &ldquo;barbarians,&rdquo; because of their little knowledge
of the language at the beginning; and he spoke of their white teeth
because the Indians regard this as a blemish, and make their own teeth
black.] In this mission of Pilitan the fathers found a madman with a
child, whom they desired to baptize as other children generally were
baptized; the father feared that they wished to take it away, and never
left it. He ate with it, slept with it, and went to the bath with it.
He did all he could to give it pleasure, but as a madman would. Hence,
often, in bathing it, he plunged it down so far under the water that he
drew it out half dead. The religious was in great anxiety, fearing some
disaster, and finally baptized it. Soon after, the father caught a
venomous serpent, ate it, and caused his child to share in the meal.
They both died, but the child to live forever, thanks to the care of
the missionary in baptizing it so as to give it grace and glory. [From
the last village which at that time had been discovered, which was
named Balisi, an Indian came with his family to that of Pilitan to
spend a few days. He brought with him his little daughter, who was only
six years old. She was so bright and charming that all who saw her
loved her. She grew so fond of the church <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb140" href="#pb140" name="pb140">140</a>]</span>that, though she was
a heathen, she wept bitterly when she was obliged by her father to
return to their own village. Soon after, falling sick to death, she was
baptized by a Spaniard named Alonso Vazquez, who happened to be there.
The Lord showed His kindness in several other striking or marvelous
instances of baptism. In one case a little girl was very ill and the
father had given his permission for baptism, but the relatives and all
the rest of the village resisted. Father Antonio de Soria went there
and asked him that they would let him look at her to cure her.
Spreading over her a moist cloth which he had brought purposely, he
cured her soul, which was soon to taste the joys of eternal
salvation.</p>
<p>To the province of Pangasinan there was added by this chapter a
church and village, that of San Jacintho, which was formed here of
people from different regions, on a very pleasant river named
Magaldan,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e891src" href="#xd21e891" name=
"xd21e891src">24</a> the inhabitants gathering to it from several
villages and some from the mountains of the region. The Lord showed His
kindness to one woman by striking her with blindness when she purposed
to run away from the baptism which she had promised to receive, and by
thus bringing her back to the salvation of her soul.</p>
<p>At this time the Lord took to himself father Fray Antonio de Soria,
one of the first missionaries of Nueva Segovia<span class="corr" id=
"xd21e896" title="Not in source">.</span> He did not enter upon the
religious life, as generally happens, when he was in boyhood or youth,
but in mature manhood. He had been left a widower; and though he had
sons to care for, he provided for them in such a way that he was no
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb141" href="#pb141" name=
"pb141">141</a>]</span>longer needed to attend to them. Being thus left
free for the service of God alone, he determined to become a religious,
and was accepted in the convent of our order at Puebla de Los Angeles,
in Nueva Espa&ntilde;a. Most persons of this age and condition,
especially when they have lived in the luxuries which are common in
Nueva Espa&ntilde;a, find it difficult to accommodate themselves to the
severities of religious life, both in little and in great things.
Father Antonio was not such. He began with the greatest humility to
study Latin, and became a master of the tongue. He entered upon greater
studies, following them with such success that he was made lecturer in
arts and a director of students. And as he was so superior not only in
his learning, but also in virtue, he was also appointed master of
novices, which is the same thing as being a teacher of the religious
life. He joined the fathers who came to these islands in 1595, and
became one of the first missionaries to the province of Nueva Segovia,
there suffering all the want, discomfort, and hunger which have been
described. The first results of his mission were at Camalaniugan, where
he drove a demon out of a woman who was possessed. In the following
provincial chapter, he was appointed superior of Nueva Segovia, to
preach to and teach and guide the Spanish, who in these new conquests
need the best of teachers. For his consolation they gave him the care
of the villages of Camalaniugan and Buguey. Not satisfied with all
this, he also took charge of the village of Daludu.] There lived in
that city Captain Alonso de Carvajal, encomendero of Pilitan, which is
distant from the city five or more days&rsquo; journey. He collected
his tribute from the natives, and desired <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb142" href="#pb142" name="pb142">142</a>]</span>to give them a
minister, as he was obliged; but he was unable to find anyone who was
willing to undertake the mission. He accordingly urged father Fray
Antonio to go to visit these Indians and their country, called Yrraya,
to see if he could attract them to the law of God and the belief in His
holy gospel. The journey was long and hard, not only because it was up
the river, but because there were enemies on the road; and, besides,
there was no religious to leave in his place. Yet the desire of
converting heathen was so strong in father Fray Antonio that he
overcame all these obstacles and went to this new spiritual conquest,
in which all of the rest of the religious soon aided him. He preached
the holy gospel, and the Lord gave him such favor with that tribe, that
he led them by his command like tame sheep. The credit which they gave
to his teaching was such that long after, when Christianity was more
settled in Yrraya, and there was some difficulty in rooting out some
superstition which had remained among them, the old people said:
&ldquo;If father Fray Antonio had commanded us that, there would not
now be a trace of it, or anyone to contradict him.&rdquo; To build the
church in the village of Pilitan, he threw down the hut of an old
woman, a noted anitera, by whom the devil gave answers to the questions
which were asked him. As this was done in this hut, the devil regarded
it as his own, and therefore greatly resented the overthrow of it. This
he said on many occasions, and he even sometimes said that he had
killed the father for tearing down his hut. But in this the Father of
Lies should not be credited; for, as he often confessed, he was not
able to appear before the religious; how <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb143" href="#pb143" name="pb143">143</a>]</span>much less, then, to
kill them. The manner of living followed by this father among these
Indians was exemplary, and such as to cause wonder among them. He
suffered and endured many hardships, and hunger and want, that he might
not inconvenience them. He was at once the master and the servant, at
the house. In order that a boy who served him by preparing his food
might not be offended at the work, the father went to the river and
carried the water that he had to drink; he was the sacristan who cared
for the church, the porter who closed and opened the doors of the
house. He it was who attended to everything that was needed, that he
might not trouble any persons by making them serve him. It was a
journey of a day and a half from Pilitan to the village of Nalavangan.
He went there and built a church, and baptized many; for the spirit of
Fray Antonio was to undertake much, and he was never contented with
that which would have seemed excessive to others. While he was engaged
in these holy exercises, the time of the intermediate chapter arrived,
and he was obliged to go to it to Manila. Here he was definitor, and
gave an account of the good work which was being wrought by the Lord in
the conversion of Yrraya. The chapter, feeling that the Lord had chosen
him therefor, appointed him as first vicar of San Pablo at Pilitan. He
returned in great contentment, because he was going where he would have
more to do than in other places, much as there was to do everywhere,
since all of these were new conversions, where the labor is great and
the ease very little. When he was among his children he gave himself
with such devotion to the labor of the ministry that within six months
he was <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb144" href="#pb144" name=
"pb144">144</a>]</span>attacked by a mortal disease, which obliged him
to return to the city to be cared for. Here, when he had received the
holy sacrament, he gave up his soul to his Creator, to the great sorrow
of all the religious, who were greatly afflicted to lose such a father
and associate. He made some compositions in the language of the
natives, which served as a guide to those who followed him; but the
greatest guidance that he gave was that of his life spent and consumed
in these so holy exercises.</p>

<h3 class="label">Chapter LII</h3>
<h3 class="main">Fathers Fray Pedro de Soto, Fray Juan de San Pedro
Martyr, and Fray Pedro de la Bastida who died at this time.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">[Father Fray Pedro de Soto was a native of Burgos, and
assumed the habit in the convent of San Andres at Medina del Campo,
where he professed, and whence he went to study in the distinguished
convent of San Pablo at Valladolid. Here he showed signs of his great
ability and the subtlety of his mind, soaring above his fellow-students
as does a royal eagle above all other birds of less flight. In him the
fathers hoped that they were to have a third Soto, in addition to the
other two famous ones whom that province has had. He exhibited as much
virtue as learning. When the religious for this province began to be
gathered, his superiors were planning that he should become a
professor. The devotion and the severity of the discipline, and the
opportunity to save souls, attracted father Fray Pedro; he was also
influenced by the example of his two masters, Fray Miguel de Venavides
and Fray Antonio Arcediano, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb145" href=
"#pb145" name="pb145">145</a>]</span>who had left their chairs of
theology to enter the new province, as had also two other fathers,
lecturers in arts at the same convent. The father master Fray Hernando
del Castillo, who was then prior, strove by all means to prevent him
from going; but the calling and inspiration of God prevailed in the
heart of father Fray Pedro. He arrived at Manila July 23, and on the
day of our father St. Dominic, less than a fortnight later, they asked
him to hold some public discussions of theology in the main church.
Father Fray Pedro avoided display of his knowledge and ability; but, on
occasions when necessity required him to speak, he made evident the
great superiority of his mind and his great learning. In the first
distribution of the religious, he was assigned to Pangasinan. The
people of this region still lived in their ancient villages and
rancherias in the hills and mountains, without civilization, order, or
system, any more than if they had never known Spaniards. Father Fray
Pedro lived among these tribes for three years, suffering the hardships
and perils which have been already described. He was constantly in
danger of death, being particularly hateful to the hostile natives
because he was the first one who learned the language of the Indians.
When some of them began to accept the faith, he offered money for
information as to those who continued to sacrifice to the devil.
Keeping secret the source of his information, he immediately went] in
haste to the place, sometimes alone, and caught the sacrificers in the
very act. Without waiting an instant, he upset everything, and broke
the dishes and bowls and other vessels which they used in their rites;
poured out their wine; burned the robes in which the aniteras
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb146" href="#pb146" name=
"pb146">146</a>]</span>or priestesses dress themselves on such
occasions, and the curtains with which they covered up everything else;
threw down the hut, and completely destroyed it. In this way he made
them understand how little all those things availed, and how vain were
the threats which the devil uttered against those who would not
venerate him; and, in brief, that this was all falsehood and deceit.
Many were thus aroused and undeceived; while others, and not a few,
were angry, so that it was a wonder that he was not slain. [The rest of
the fathers followed his plan; but father Fray Pedro led them all,
following the track of this chase, in which his scent was so keen that
nothing could escape him. At his death, father Fray Pedro was able to
say that he was sure of the two aureoles of virgin and of doctor, and
that he had almost succeeded in gaining that of martyr. The village of
Magaldan was the most obstinate of all these villages in their errors.
They had striven to kill a father of the Order of St. Francis, insomuch
that the dagger was already lifted above him for that purpose, and he
had fled. They had refused to admit the fathers of the Order of St.
Augustine, and they would not listen to a secular priest who was
assigned to them, although the alcalde-mayor fined and punished them.
It was these Indians whom father Fray Pedro de Soto came to conquer
with patience and Christian charity. The Indians said that he never
employed a word of their language wrong. He was engaged for a whole
year in translating the gospel into this language, and translated some
lives of saints and instances of virtue&mdash;which though they were
composed in the very beginning, are still esteemed and are greatly
prized, because of the propriety of the <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb147" href="#pb147" name="pb147">147</a>]</span>words and the
elevated style with which he treated these matters. He was devoted to
the study of theology and sacred letters, and was continual in both
mental and vocal prayer, to which he added fasting. Being taken to
Manila to be treated for the fever from which he suffered, he died
there.</p>
<p>In spite of the failure of the two previous expeditions to Camboja,
the governor, Don Francisco Tello, judged it desirable to send another
ship with troops, and asked the order to send some of their friars with
it. The father provincial directed that father Fray Juan de S. Pedro
Martyr (or Maldonado) and father Fray Pedro Jesus (or de la Bastida)
should go. Father Fray Juan was then commissary of the Holy Office. He
was a native of Alcala de Guadiana,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e922src"
href="#xd21e922" name="xd21e922src">25</a> and belonged to a rich and
honorable family. He studied canon law at Salamanca, and assumed the
habit in the illustrious convent of San Pablo at Valladolid. The
influence of Father Juan Chrisostomo attracted him to the new province
to be established in the Philippinas Islands. When he was about to set
forth, a certain Doctor Bobadilla, a canon in the church in Valladolid,
took him to one side and assured him that he was to die a martyr; and
this prophecy was corroborated by another devoted monk. It was on this
account that he changed his name of Maldonado to that of S. Pedro
Martyr. He spent his first year in the Philipinas in Manila; and in his
second year was sent as vicar to a village in Pangasinan, which was at
that time the most difficult in the province. From that place he was
transferred to the vicariate of Bataan, <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb148" href="#pb148" name="pb148">148</a>]</span>the language of which
he learned very well. When Father Juan Cobo went as ambassador to
Japon, father Fray Juan was assigned to the mission to the Chinese,
being thus required to learn a third language in addition to the two
which he already knew. He learned more words of the Chinese language
than any other member of the order, though he was not successful with
the pronunciation. He assisted the Chinese so much that they named him
as their protector; and he was, as it were, the advocate of their
causes, so that they became very much attached to him, and listened
with good-will to his preaching and his corrections. During the absence
of the father provincial in Camboja, the province could find no one
more suitable to govern it in his place, and accordingly father Fray
Juan was nominated as vicar-general. In the following provincial
chapter he was appointed lecturer in theology, for there was nothing
which the province did not find him competent to do. He made no
objection to carrying out any orders that were given him, although they
dragged him about hither and thither, causing him to learn so many
languages and immediately to drop them again. This is a great evidence
of his obedience and subjection to his superior. His reputation outside
of the order was very great.] The tribunal of the Holy Office of Mexico
appointed him commissary-general of the Philippinas, which office he
filled with the prudence and strength of mind which the Lord has given
in these regions to the sons of the first inquisitor-general, our
father St. Dominic. Don Luis Perez das Mari&ntilde;as, a wise and holy
knight, refused to accept the governorship of these islands until Fray
Juan persuaded him to do so, stood security for him, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb149" href="#pb149" name="pb149">149</a>]</span>and
undertook the duty of confessing him and of aiding him with his good
advice, that he might the better fulfil the office. This he did in
spite of the fact that this was certain to be, as it was, to his own
damage; for suitors who did not receive what they desired immediately
threw the blame on Father Juan, whom they well knew that the governor
consulted as to the appointments which he made. Father Fray Juan knew
all this well, but accepted it very readily, in order that he might
undertake the direction of so upright a man as Don Luis. In spite of
the fact that the esteem which was felt for Father Juan within and
without the order was very great, the counterweight of humility and the
consciousness of his own inferiority which he had was much greater. He
regarded himself as the most useless in all the province, and treated
himself as such. Hence, when he was named for vicar-general of the
province, he managed that this title and office should be given to
father Fray Juan de Sancto Thomas. [In the same way, when he was
nominated prior of the convent of Manila at the time when father Fray
Diego de Soria went as procurator to Espa&ntilde;a, he succeeded in
bringing about the election of another religious. He likewise strove to
resign the office of commissary in favor of father Fray Bernardo de
Sancta Cathalina, or Navarro. Such was the character of father Fray
Juan de San Pedro Martyr, whom the province was willing to spare for
the mission to Camboja. They would have spared an even more perfect
religious if they could, well knowing that he who had to preach the
gospel in a heathen kingdom like this should be such as father Fray
Juan was, or even greater in all things. The companion <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb150" href="#pb150" name="pb150">150</a>]</span>of
father Fray Juan, father Fray Pedro de Jesus or de la Bastida, a
religious of great virtue, had come to the islands in the previous
year, 1591, with the rest who were brought from Espa&ntilde;a by father
Fray Francisco de Morales. He had displayed high qualities in the
mission to Bataan, to which he had been assigned. He had come from the
very devout province of Aragon, of which he was a son. When they
reached the great river of Camboja, father Fray Juan endeavored to
carry out his mission, both for the conversion of those tribes and as
an ambassador of the king our lord. He was contemptuously treated by
the king,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e931src" href="#xd21e931" name=
"xd21e931src">26</a> the son of that king who had sent to ask for
religious. The present king was wholly in the hands of Mahometan
Malays, who persuaded him that the embassy involved some evil to him.
When father Fray Juan asked his permission to return to the ship which
they had left in the port, the king refused to grant it, and thus
showed that he was plotting treachery. Father Fray Juan saw no
opportunity for preaching the gospel, as the country was disturbed and
in arms; and as the two captains, Diego Velloso and Blas Ruiz de Fernan
Goncalez, were in a difficult situation because their comrades were so
few, and the Malays, their enemies, were in such favor. The captain of
the ship [<i>i.e.</i>, Mendoza] attempted to secure peace between these
factions, but did not disembark from his vessel. The same thing was
done by the captain of a fragata that had come from Sian. The Malays,
seeing that they had the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb151" href=
"#pb151" name="pb151">151</a>]</span>advantage because their vessel was
larger and stronger than ours, made an attack and shot contrivances of
fire and powder to burn the Spaniards and the Japanese. The ship caught
fire, and those on board had to leap into the water to escape. Father
Fray Pedro de Jesus was unable to swim, and took refuge from the fire
on the poop. Here the Moros came out in small boats and thrust lances
at him. He fell into the water and died of his wounds, or was drowned
by the hands of the Moros. This vessel had done no harm to the Moros,
and had not even tried to aid the Spanish captains in the kingdom. The
only reason for attacking it was the desire of the Moros to prevent the
preaching of the gospel; and hence father Fray Pedro died a glorious
martyr. Father Fray Juan succeeded in reaching the fragata commanded by
Juan de Mendo&ccedil;a. In it father Fray Juan made his escape to Sian,
being wounded in the throat by a shot which had passed obliquely
through it; and thus half of the prophecy had been fulfilled that he
and his comrade were to die the death of martyrs. Father Fray Juan went
to Sian that he might be near to the kingdom of Camboja. The king of
that country was a cruel and barbarous tyrant; he took delight in
causing men to be thrown to wild elephants, who tore them to pieces
with their trunks. He caused others to be fried with a very small
quantity of oil, and their flesh to be torn off from them with pincers
while they were thus tortured, and to be thrust into their mouths, that
by force of the pain which they suffered they might bite and eat their
own flesh. When there were no criminals, he used to perpetrate these
cruelties solely for his own recreation; and that not to one, or a few,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb152" href="#pb152" name=
"pb152">152</a>]</span>but to a thousand at a time. Only a few days
before, he had had four or five Portuguese fried alive for some
trifling offense, for which they had already paid a fine to him. There
were here at this time a Portuguese religious, Fray Jorje de la
Mota,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e945src" href="#xd21e945" name=
"xd21e945src">27</a> and several other Portuguese who were now trying
to escape from the country. The force of the tides is so great that,
when the tide is coming in, it is impossible to make head against it;
and as they were fifty leguas from the sea, it was easy to follow and
catch them. Overjoyed with the possibility of escape offered by the
coming of Father Juan, they prayed him for the love of God to rescue
them in his boat without the knowledge of the king. The Spaniards
planned to do so; but, because of the too great haste and anxiety of
the Portuguese, the vessel was followed and found before it had made
its escape into the sea. The king was mad with rage, and sent three
separate expeditions after it. They surrounded the boat and fired at it
with small cannon, arquebuses, arrows, and lances. There were about
twenty persons, Castilians and Portuguese, on the ship, and they had
about a dozen muskets and a few arquebuses to protect themselves with.
So long as the tide was going out, they managed to defend themselves
fairly well, because they could manage to engage a part of the enemy
only at one time. When the tide came in they were obliged to anchor,
and they were like a target for the Sianese. After three days of this
torture, they managed to get to sea. The pilot had been slain by a
shot; and the captain, Juan de Mendoca, and father Fray Jorje de la
Mota were so badly wounded that they afterward died. The <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb153" href="#pb153" name="pb153">153</a>]</span>arm
of father Fray Juan de San Pedro Martir was broken by a shot from a
small culverin. As they had lost all their drinking-water in the
combat, the sufferings of father Fray Juan were very great. He saw that
his hour was come, and confessed to father Fray Jorje. He wrote to the
fathers in this province an account of the fortunes of this voyage; and
expressed his joy in dying on an expedition carried out by the command
of his superior for the purpose of preaching the gospel, in which he
had saved those poor Portuguese from dreadful danger to both their
lives and their souls.] Almost at the end of the letter which he sent
he wrote: &ldquo;What we have in this province is good, and God is
greatly served in the province. Let us strive to keep what we have, by
observing those things which we have established; for I am sure that
God will show us a thousand favors. The arms of Saul do not fit all
men; nor is preaching in these regions suitable to any but a very holy
man.&rdquo; [They buried him on land near the port of Cochinchina, on
an island called Pulocatovan, at the root of a tree&mdash;not daring to
set up a cross, for fear of the derision of those heathen. He had set
out upon this voyage certain to meet his death in it; and at the
beginning of the expedition he had shown the perfection of his
obedience in several ways.]</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">[On the second of June, 1600, the electors assembled
in the convent of Manila to elect a successor <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb154" href="#pb154" name="pb154">154</a>]</span>to
father Fray Bernardo de Sancta Cathalina. The example of father Fray
Bernardo was so grand that it was difficult for his successor to reach
the same pitch of excellence. Although all felt that father Fray Juan
de Sancto Thomas, or Ormaca, was fitted for the position by character
and abilities, there was some doubt whether his ill-health would permit
him to fill the office as it ought to be filled. He was constantly
under the necessity of receiving dispensations from the severity of the
rules; and though this did no harm in a private friar, it was most
unfortunate in a superior. It was also feared that he would be
physically unable to perform the duties of the situation. One of the
best physicians of the city was called in, without the knowledge of
father Fray Juan, to express his opinion as to the ability of father
Fray Juan to fulfil the duties of the office. His judgment was
favorable, and father Fray Juan was elected. The election was a most
fortunate one, for father Fray Juan was able, learned, and holy; and
his nature was so gentle that the vicar-general, Fray Juan de Castro,
who had a gift from heaven of special insight into character, chose him
as his usual associate, and appointed him to the first position as
superior in a mission to Indians. He filled the office well, and not
only lived out the four years of his provincialship, but has seen ten
other elections of provincials since his own; and he is still alive
while this is being written, in the year 1637. Since he is still
living, let us content ourselves with what has been said&mdash;leaving
the rest till the time when, after the end of his life, it may be
discussed with greater freedom. During his term, the Lord opened the
gates for the entrance of the order to <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb155" href="#pb155" name="pb155">155</a>]</span>Japan, as will be
narrated later; this was a great reward for the hardships suffered by
the religious of this province, and by him in particular, from the
perils and miseries of travel by land and by sea. Many new convents
were admitted at this chapter, both in Pangasinan and Nueva Segovia;
for the duties of the ministry in these regions were constantly
increasing, and the religious kept constantly reaching out to new
places. Many excellent ordinances were passed for the exercise of the
ministry to the Indians, and also for the better maintenance of the
rules affecting us&mdash;especially in the matter of showing ourselves
disinterested, and careful not to annoy the Indians.</p>
<p>In the province of Nueva Segovia the religious labored hard in the
search throughout mountains and valleys, and other secret places, for
the huts where the devil had been adored, to which those people used to
make pilgrimages in search of health or other favors, giving offerings
of bits of gold, or of stones regarded by them as precious. The natives
dared not take anything from those places, or cut a reed or a tree from
the natural growth of the earth in them, for fear of death, with which
the devil had threatened them. In the villages on the coast many such
little huts were found, with many little figures and idols in them. The
religious burnt and broke the boxes with the offerings<span class=
"corr" id="xd21e963" title="Source: :">;</span> took the gold and the
stones, and all the other offerings; and burnt and ground to dust
everything, and cast it into the sea, that it might not remain to be a
stumbling-block to the Indians. When the heathen saw that the threats
of the devil were not being carried out, their eyes were opened and
they were very eager to be baptized. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb156" href="#pb156" name="pb156">156</a>]</span>Great aid was
received from an epidemic of smallpox which attacked a whole region. In
this way the Lord took to himself many souls, especially of children;
for there were many newly baptized in the province of Pangasinan and in
that of Nueva Segovia.] Many of those who seemed to be near their end
recovered after they received the water of baptism. All, therefore,
came to be baptized, and the Lord, by means of those who recovered,
gave authority to the baptism; while of the vast number who died
baptized He peopled heaven with new angels. This brought great comfort
to the missionaries, who, although worn out and greatly fatigued by
going from house to house baptizing and confessing, and giving the
sacraments to sick persons, saw their labors successful and rewarded by
the sending to heaven of so many souls, and also by the strengthening
of their hope that they should go to accompany those souls in glory;
for it is not possible that these should not be grateful, and pray and
strive to obtain salvation for those who labored, with such zeal, to
give it to them by the means of baptism, without which it cannot be
obtained.</p>
<p>[Soon after the provincial chapter, one of the definitors, father
Fray Damian Balaguer, died. He had lived but a short time in the
province, but had gained great reputation in it; and his early death
was much mourned. He was a native of the kingdom of Valencia, and had
two brothers in the same order&mdash;one, the present Fray Pedro Martyr
de Balaguer; and the other master Fray Andres Balaguer, at one time
bishop of Albarracin and afterward of Origuela. Father Fray Damian took
the habit in the convent of the Preachers in Valencia, which
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb157" href="#pb157" name=
"pb157">157</a>]</span>has been happy in giving saints to the church.
During all his novitiate, the master of the novices never had occasion
to discipline him, even for the merest trifle&mdash;although by the
advice of another father he assigned him some discipline, without any
fault on the part of Fray Damian, but not without a cause; for it is
necessary for the novices to be initiated in these punishments of the
order, that they may not afterward be new and strange to them. He was
constant in prayer and fasting, given to speaking of the things of God,
and to mortification. For many years he was accustomed to repeat the
whole of the Psalter of David daily, in imitation of St. Vincent of
Ferrara. He studied at Origuela, becoming a lecturer in arts in the
same college, and afterward in theology&mdash;having a singular grace
given him to declare with clearness the gravest and most profound
difficulties of this holy science. He was an excellent and a moving
preacher, having the power to change the hearts of many of his hearers,
who selected him as their spiritual guide. Whenever he left the
convent, which he did only on important occasions, he was followed by a
troop of his disciples, who gathered not only to honor him, but to
profit by what they heard him say. He showed all his life the greatest
humility, and from day to day did not change, except by the
augmentation and advance of his virtue. Being eager for the conversion
of souls, he went to Mexico with master Fray Alonso Bayllo, who was
going out to Mexico with authority to divide the province of Vaxac from
that of Santiago.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e972src" href="#xd21e972"
name="xd21e972src">28</a> For the space of two years he directed
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb158" href="#pb158" name=
"pb158">158</a>]</span>the schools in the city of Vaxac; but, as that
was not the end which he had intended, he was dissatisfied. When he
heard that many ministers of the holy gospel were needed in the
Philippinas, he took advantage of the arrival in Mexico of father Fray
Francisco de Morales to ask that he would take him to the islands with
the rest of the company whom he was bringing over. Arriving in 1598, he
was assigned to Nueva Segovia, where in a short time he learned enough
of the language to be able to hear confessions. Father Fray Damian was
first vicar and superior of the mission of Abulug. As such, he was a
definitor in the provincial chapter, and returned to Nueva Segovia as
vicar of the village of Pata. He died greatly mourned.</p>
<p>At this time there died in the same province of Nueva Segovia
brother Fray Domingo de San Blas, a lay religious of much virtue and
known sanctity, a son of the convent of San Pablo at Sevilla, who came
to these islands in the year 1594. He was of much use to the Indians,
of whose language he learned enough to be understood by them and to
teach them to pray, to attract the Christians to the church, and to
teach the heathen the knowledge of the doctrine of Christianity. He was
fervent in prayer, being often moved to sighs and tears during his
devotions. He strove to hide them from his companion, father Fray
Ambrosio de la Madre de Dios, but was unable <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb159" href="#pb159" name="pb159">159</a>]</span>to
do so. Father Fray Ambrosio said to him that, as they two lived alone
and like brothers, there was no reason why one should try to conceal
anything from the other. With this permission from his superior he
broke out in sobs, and his heart melted away in tears, directed mainly
to the conversion of these heathen and to the perfecting in
Christianity of the already baptized. Two extraordinary things happened
in this village of Pata while this brother lived there: One was the
receiving of a fish on the day of St. Dominic, under such circumstances
that there could be no doubt that the Lord had sent it to enable them
properly to celebrate the feast of the holy founder of this order. The
second event was the marvelous recovery or restoration to life, at the
intercession of St. Dominic, of an Indian who had been given over for
dead. It was the very man who had given them the fish. Father Fray
Domingo died from exposure to the sun. He was sent back to the convent
of Manila for care, and there grew worse; and, after having very
devoutly received the holy sacraments, exchanged this wretched life for
the eternal one.]</p>

<div class="divHead">
<h3 class="label">Chapter LIV</h3>
<h3 class="main">The intermediate chapter; an extraordinary event which
took place in it, and the coming of religious to the province.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In the year of our Lord 1602, the voting fathers
assembled in their intermediate provincial chapter, at which was
accepted the house of San Juan del Monte, which is situated a legua
from the city of Manila in a solitary place, a healthful and pleasant
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb160" href="#pb160" name=
"pb160">160</a>]</span>situation. There were two motives and ends with
which this house was built. The first was the consideration that some
aged fathers, after their many labors and years passed in the ministry,
desired, having performed the duties of Martha, to give themselves up
wholly to those of Mary by leading the life of contemplation. For this
purpose the locality is very well suited, for there is nothing in it to
disturb the calm of prayer and contemplation. But it did not serve much
for this end, because it was soon found by experience that these
servants of God, the aged ministers, were of much more usefulness in
the ministries, since their example and authority were very efficacious
for the spiritual increase of faith and devotion in the Indians.
Teaching and doctrine were received much better from such venerable
ministers, who were well known, loved, and regarded. It was also found
that the example of these venerable fathers was of great use to those
who had newly entered upon the ministry, since they could not fail to
venerate and follow the acts and the teaching which they beheld in
these ancient and venerable ministers. Even though there are some who
on account of their great age and infirmity can not continue in the
service, they are of more use in the convent of the city, where their
infirmities may be better cared for, and where their good example and
venerable age are more valuable. The second motive and object is one
which is obviously of great advantage. It is found that in the city
convalescence takes place slowly, or not at all; therefore those who
are being treated for any sickness leave the city for their
convalescence, by the advice of the physicians. If the order did not
have this convent outside of the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb161"
href="#pb161" name="pb161">161</a>]</span>city, in a situation which is
healthful and where the air is good&mdash;which is what convalescents
most require&mdash;the religious would be obliged to ask for permission
to go for their convalescence to the farms or fruit-gardens of laymen,
which are never so appropriate as the convent. Now that they have this
convent, no permission is granted to go for convalescence to any other
place, which is to the great advantage of the province. Also when a
religious is worn out and afflicted by the heats of the city, which are
very great, he is permitted to go and obtain some refreshment and ease
at San Juan del Monte, and soon returns to his labors in the city with
new energy; and this, too, is of great value. While the fathers were
assembled at this chapter an event occurred which caused special awe in
the hearts of the religious, and created greater respect for the sacred
constitutions which we promise to observe. Even when the obligation
does not involve a matter of sin, even venial sin, still the Lord
desires us to keep them with the greatest accuracy&mdash;not only in
matters of importance, but even in the less significant ones. It was a
very extraordinary incident, and one which seems to have happened like
the blindness of the man who was born blind, as the gospel tells us,
&ldquo;not because of his own sins nor those of his fathers, but for
the glory of God.&rdquo; Although there was a fault, it was such a
fault as the Lord is accustomed to pass over (and even greater ones) in
us. Therefore it was, as I said, that it seemed to be for the greater
glory of God and of St. Cecilia, who, as we shall see, had a share in
the remedy. There was a religious who came from the province of
Andalucia, in which he had lived in a very devout convent. It happened
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb162" href="#pb162" name=
"pb162">162</a>]</span>one evening that this religious ate between
meals a few capers without the permission and blessing of the superior.
This is something which in the eyes of men did not appear a special
fault; but it was so in the sight of God, who punished this excess.
From that evening the religious suffered from a pain, which seemed to
him to be in his heart. Although from evening to evening it sometimes
was very severe, still it was not of such a nature that on account of
it they hesitated to ordain him, or, after he was ordained, prohibited
him from the use of the orders which he had received. He came into
these regions, and went as minister to the Indians in Pangasinan. In
the course of time his sufferings increased, and afflicted him to such
an extent that he was prohibited from saying mass, as it was feared
that the malady would attack him during the celebration. During this
time when he did not celebrate mass, his malady continually increased
and afflicted him more than before, so that the religious suffered
great torture; and they gave him great care, and as much comfort as was
consistent with our poverty. In spite of this he grew worse and worse,
and suffered greater afflictions and torments. It attacked him one day,
and they gave him some relics. Thereupon he began to be so furious that
he lifted up and carried along the religious who came to hold him. It
seemed to them that it was some evil spirit which received the holy
thing so ill. The prior at that time, who was father Fray Francisco de
Morales, afterward a holy martyr in Japon, asked permission of the
father provincial to exorcise him. While he was saying the litany, the
grimaces and gestures made by the afflicted man were many; but when the
prior <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb163" href="#pb163" name=
"pb163">163</a>]</span>reached the glorious name of the martyr St.
Cecilia, his fury became so great that with the torment of it he fell
to the ground, deprived of strength as if in a faint. Now it happened
that this religious was very devoted to this most illustrious saint,
and had composed a special office which he used to recite out of
devotion to her. He had even abandoned his own proper surname, and was
called and called himself &ldquo;de Sancta Cecilia.&rdquo; Although he
did not perceive it himself, this was of great aid to him against the
devil who tormented him; therefore it was that the evil spirit resented
it so much when the religious invoked her. When the religious saw this,
they called upon her many times, and all those present made a vow to
fast for a day on bread and water, from reverence for this saint. The
provincial vowed to celebrate a feast in her honor, and the church and
an altar were prepared for saying a mass to her with great solemnity.
All the religious were with the afflicted friar in the choir, singing
the mass to the saint. At the first <i>Kyrie</i>, he began to be
changed; and, when the priest said the first prayer, the noise which he
made in the choir was so great that he disturbed the ministers who were
at the altar. While they were singing in the creed the words <i lang=
"la">Ex Maria Virgine, et homo factus est</i> [of the Virgin Mary and
was made man] the noise became very much greater; and at the lifting up
of the Host his sobs and groans and cries were so loud that, to avoid
exciting the people in the church, they kept sounding clarions to the
end of the mass. They took him from the choir to the oratory. Here in
the presence of all the religious gathered together, he performed an
act of humility, saying that his faults had brought him to <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb164" href="#pb164" name="pb164">164</a>]</span>this
wretched state, and begging them to pray to God to pardon him; and
that, if it was best for him to suffer all the pains of hell, he was
ready to receive them. He asked permission of the provincial to kiss
the feet of those who were present. The provincial comforted him, and
they went on with the exorcism, during which the devil became calmer.
The friar answered all the questions which were put to him, and, when
they gave him the holy cross, he kissed it with reverence. These were
evidences of his recovery. The friar became so weary that it was
necessary for him to repose. When he lay down to sleep it seemed to
him, whether in dreams or not he could not tell, that the devil
complained of being suffocated, that a religious was repeating
exorcisms to him, and that the glorious St. Cecilia came to his
assistance. On the following day the religious fasted, as they had
promised, on bread and water, and repeated the exorcisms. During them
it became evident that the evil guest had departed, and that he must be
one of those of whom the Lord said that they are not to be cast out
except by fasting and prayer. There was no more necessity of cure for
that malady. As a result, the religious became very much devoted to
this glorious saint, who has favored the order on many other occasions;
and they became very fearful of violating the constitutions, when they
saw that the Lord was zealous for them in such a manner. Among the
babblings which the Father of Lies muttered through the mouth of the
afflicted friar, it was noticed that when he was directed to read the
epistle in the mass of the cross, where the apostle says, <i lang=
"la">Christus factus est pro nobis obediens <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb165" href="#pb165" name=
"pb165">165</a>]</span>usque ad mortem</i>,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e1015src" href="#xd21e1015" name="xd21e1015src">29</a> he read
<i lang="la">pro vobis</i> [<i>i.e.</i>, &ldquo;for your sake&rdquo;],
excluding the devils from the benefit of the holy Passion. When one of
those present said that Christ our Lord had not died for devils, the
proud one answered immediately: &ldquo;Then we have the less to be
thankful for.&rdquo; When he reached the words of the apostle, that
&ldquo;at the name of Jesus every knee shall bow, of those who are in
heaven, on earth, and in the hells,&rdquo; he refused to utter this
last word, which affects the devils; and, when they forced him to utter
it, he answered that it was enough to say that every tongue should
confess that He was seated at the right hand of the Father. All this
was to continue further the pride with which he was always
tormented.</p>
<p>At the same time, at the end of April, those religious reached
Manila whom father Fray Diego de Soria had collected in Espa&ntilde;a
during the previous year. He assembled them at the port, where he
delivered them to father Fray Thomas Hernandez,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e1028src" href="#xd21e1028" name="xd21e1028src">30</a> father Fray
Diego remaining in Espa&ntilde;a to collect and conduct another
company, in which he succeeded. The body of friars which arrived at
this time was one of the best which had come to this province.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e1031src" href="#xd21e1031" name=
"xd21e1031src">31</a> It contained fourteen members from the colleges
of the provinces of Espa&ntilde;a, Aragon and Romana. These were all
very superior in ability <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb166" href=
"#pb166" name="pb166">166</a>]</span>and advanced in knowledge, and
still more so in religion and virtue. The provinces of Espa&ntilde;a
were not a little grieved to lose them. There, however, there was a
very easy remedy because of the many who were left behind; while for
this province these friars were of the greatest value, and have given
it dignity and support in various ways, in the offices that belong to
it. It appeared from the beginning that the Lord gave them His
benediction, and such a spirit of constancy and firmness that, although
they had the most urgent reasons for remaining behind, not one of those
who were designated failed to come. This is something which probably
never happened with any other shipload. There also came many besides
[the fourteen above mentioned], taking the chance as to their being
desired, which was an even greater marvel. This was in the year
sixty-one, when Sevilla was afflicted with the plague. It was here that
the religious were to assemble, and to wait for the sailing of the
fleet. On the road, they met many who asked them where they were going.
When they answered, &ldquo;To Sevilla,&rdquo; those that heard them
were amazed and answered: &ldquo;You see, fathers, that we, who are
inhabitants of Sevilla, have abandoned our houses and our fortunes
almost to destruction, fleeing from the plague there. Are your
Reverences going to place yourselves in the midst of it?&rdquo; But
nothing sufficed to prevent a single one of them from continuing his
journey, for they regarded dying in such an enterprise as good fortune,
and death on such a journey as happy. At the court father Fray Thomas
Hernandez and three companions who were with him found the father
provincial of Espa&ntilde;a, who at that time was the father master
Fray Andres <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb167" href="#pb167" name=
"pb167">167</a>]</span>de Caso, an intimate friend of him who at that
time was president of the Indias. He said to them, &ldquo;Where are you
going? There is no fleet, for the president of the Indias has told me
so.&rdquo; In spite of all this, the religious were all moved by a
higher impulse; and although it was true that, on account of the
plague, it had been ordered that there should be no fleet, one was
afterward permitted to sail. The religious reached Sevilla after much
hardship; because in many places they were unwilling to admit them to
the towns, or to private houses, or even to our own convents, so great
was the fear of the plague. They were even unwilling to be satisfied
with the evidence that the religious brought with them that they were
healthy. When they reached Sevilla they saw the plague-stricken taken
almost dead to the hospitals and even this did not frighten them. They
were in the Guerta del Corco [<i>i.e.</i>, &ldquo;garden of the
deer&rdquo;]; and there one of them was taken with the plague, and was
carried suddenly off in two more days. Even then, not one of them even
thought of giving up the voyage, although they saw the plague and death
within the house where they were dwelling. The Lord favored them so
that no one else took the plague. When they saw the danger more
clearly, they gave greater thanks to Him who had not only rescued them
from it, but had taken from them the fear which they naturally had of
it&mdash;especially as they had almost all come on foot, asking alms,
all the way from the innermost parts of Castilla la Vieja; and though
they were persons who were not inured to that sort of hardship, and
therefore were the more likely to fall sick, especially in a season of
plague. [The religious who died was <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb168" href="#pb168" name="pb168">168</a>]</span>Fray Juan de Solis, a
son of the licentiate Jofre de Solis. He was a man of jovial
disposition and fond of company, but corrected his weakness when he
proposed to go to the Philippinas. His relatives and several of his
fellow-friars tried to dissuade him, but he insisted upon going. In
Sevilla, as there was no lay religious with them, he undertook the duty
of cooking for the rest of the company; and it may be that the great
heat and consequent exhaustion were the reasons for his being taken by
the plague.] When the religious reached Sevilla, they were received
with much joy and charity by father Fray Diego de Soria. Everything
they had&mdash;their books, their clothes, their money, and everything,
down to their very handkerchiefs&mdash;all became common property; if
they had any debts unpaid, the community took charge of these, and the
religious were left without any care, and even without the use of
anything for themselves, except the habit which they wore. From that
day they even said all their masses for the community, which provided
for every one what he had need of, while no one possessed anything (not
even by permission) except books. Everything else was in common for all
of them; and hence they did not have to think of carrying anything with
them for the voyage, except the very small outfit provided for the
whole company. [On the voyage they strove to live as much as possible
as if they were in a very strict convent. They encountered a frightful
storm, so great that there was not a single vessel which did not lose
at least one mast; and one of the largest and best of the vessels
foundered, although without loss of life. Even the pilots confessed,
which they avoid as much as possible for fear of disheartening the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb169" href="#pb169" name=
"pb169">169</a>]</span>crew. The ship on which the religious were was
very old, and was being sent on its last voyage, to be broken up and
sold as old lumber in the port. In response to a vow of the religious,
the Virgin of the Rosary showed them grace, and brought the storm to an
end. In Mexico some were sick, but none died; and not one remained
behind. This greatly astonished the fathers of the province of Mexico,
because in every shipload some give up the distant mission&mdash;being
wearied by the voyage which they have taken, fearful of the dangers to
come, and pleased with the delightful climate of Mexico. This shipload
was the first which occupied the hospice of St. Hyacinth, where they
lived as if in a convent, following all the rules of the province.
While in the hospice, they studied and had frequent theological
conferences. They very rarely visited the city. On the journey from
Mexico to Acapulco, which is very long and over a very bad road, many
of them went on foot. As this was not customary at that time, it
greatly edified those who saw them. There was only one ship in from the
Philippinas; and this and more were needed by the governor, Don Pedro
de Acu&ntilde;a, for the accommodation of himself and his troops. But
while the religious were praying and offering vows to the Virgin for
her aid, they were rejoiced by the news that one ship had come in from
the Philippinas and two from Peru, which were all taken to make up the
fleet. On the voyage they did much for the consciences of those who
were in their ship, dividing among themselves all the people, from the
admiral and his companions down to the lowest convict or ship-boy. They
taught these men and heard their confessions, opening the way of peace
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb170" href="#pb170" name=
"pb170">170</a>]</span>and liberty to many a captive and unhappy soul.
At the port of Acapulco died father Fray Vicente de Lia&ntilde;o, a
religious of much devotion and patience under suffering, for he was a
confirmed invalid. When they reached Manila they were immediately
distributed by the provincial council, which was then sitting. The
number of religious was the largest that has entered the province since
its establishment. All of the houses in the province were filled, and
enough were left to comply with the wishes of the king of Satzuma, who
had sent to ask for religious.]</p>

<div class="divHead">
<h3 class="label">Chapter LV</h3>
<h3 class="main">The causes of the entry of our religious into Japon,
and the circumstances under which they entered Satzuma.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">[Christianity in the kingdoms of Japon took its origin
from the Society of Jesus, the first preacher and apostle therein being
St. Francis Xavier. The fathers of this Society had entered Japon
according to the rule of the gospel, without weapons or soldiers, but
with peace and mercy and in the strength of holy living. Christianity
flourished so that the first missionaries were obliged to call in aid;
and they sent for assistance to the Philippinas, where at that time
there were discalced Franciscans and Augustinians, besides members of
the Society. Father Gaspar Coello, vice-provincial of the fathers in
Japon, wrote to the governor, Dr. Santiago de Vera, to the bishop, Don
Fray Domingo de Salacar, and to the guardian of St. Francis, and the
rector of the Society in Manila, urging the establishment of trade
between the Philippinas and Japon. The bishop made a number of formal
inquiries, which were <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb171" href=
"#pb171" name="pb171">171</a>]</span>verified before a notary. One is
dated at Nangasaqui, September 11, 1584; and the other from the kingdom
of Fixen, January 24, 1585. The witnesses when asked especially if it
would be an advantage to have religious of various orders, and
especially religious under the vow of poverty, replied unanimously that
such would be very well received. They called to witness the case of
the holy Fray Juan Pobre, a discalced friar who disembarked in Japon on
his way to China, and whom the Japanese, both heathen and Christian,
adored. It must be admitted that soon afterward the fathers of the
Society in Japon changed their opinion, in spite of the fact that the
extension of Christianity in Japon required more laborers in the field
and that the empire was large enough for all the religious orders. God
was pleased to put it into the heart of many of the kings, or
<i>tonos</i>, of that realm to send to Manila to ask for religious of
all the orders. The particular reason for the calling of our religious
was as follows: In 1601 a number of Japanese vessels, with many
Christians on them, touched at Manila. A number of these Christians
became very fond of our convent, and often visited it. One of them, by
name Juan Sandaya, brought the captain of his ship to the prior, Fray
Francisco de Morales; and they discussed the possibility of sending
religious of the Order of St. Dominic to Satzuma, whence the captain
came. In the following year a letter was brought from the king of
Satzuma, Tintionguen, inviting them to come to his kingdom. The letter
was dated on the twenty-second day of the ninth month in the sixth year
of Keycho.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1063src" href="#xd21e1063" name=

<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb172" href="#pb172" name=

and superior, accompanied by the fathers Fray Thomas Hernandez, Fray

sail on the day of the most holy Trinity. They carried but little in
the way of temporal things, expecting to live upon the alms which they
should receive in Japon. They rested the first night in a heathen
temple in the island of Coxiqui.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1075src"
href="#xd21e1075" name="xd21e1075src">34</a> The priest of the idols
removed the images, and left the temple unoccupied, and the fathers
consecrated it and set up in it an altar. The Japanese were very
curious about the new missionaries, and were greatly pleased with them.
They were welcomed in a few days by some Japanese gentlemen, who made
them a very ceremonious greeting and welcomed them in the name of their
king. They were escorted to the court of the tono, where they were
honorably received. The black and white colors of the habit pleased the
Japanese, for these are customary in that country; while the eating of
fish as an ordinary article of food is very common in Japon. They also
greatly admired the devotion of the fathers to study, for they esteem
their <i>boncos</i> [or &ldquo;bonzes&rdquo;] in proportion as they are
learned; but what above all they admired was the contempt of these
fathers for comforts and worldly advantages. The favor with which the
religious were received enraged the priests of the idols, who insisted
that the Japanese princes who had <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb173"
href="#pb173" name="pb173">173</a>]</span>become Christians had been
unfortunate. They mentioned the instance of Don Augustin
Tzunotami,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1083src" href="#xd21e1083" name=
"xd21e1083src">35</a> a great and valiant lord who had been destroyed
by the emperor; also that of Don Francisco, the king of Bungo,<a class=
"noteref" id="xd21e1089src" href="#xd21e1089" name=
"xd21e1089src">36</a> who had been conquered and lost his life; while
this kingdom of Satzuma had been protected by its devotion to its gods,
and especially to Faquiman, who is their god of war. It was no wonder
that two Christian princes should have been overwhelmed when thousands
of heathen had suffered the same overthrow, but the idol priests passed
that over. The emperor intervened, and enacted a decree that no king or
tono, and not even any gentleman of distinction, should become a
Christian. The king of Satzuma, however, would not banish the
religious, but gave them permission to build a church and a house. Not
infrequently, however, they were forgotten, and did not receive their
customary supply of rice. The fathers converted the family of the man
in whose house they lived, and made a chapel in the oratory of the
house. The queen was desirous of seeing the image of the Virgin
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb174" href="#pb174" name=
"pb174">174</a>]</span>which was set up in the chapel; and it was
carried to the palace, and there worshiped with the greatest respect by
the chief personages of the court. The king, being unable to make up
his mind how to treat the religious because of the opposition of the
emperor, permitted them, at their request, to return to the island of
Quoxiqui, where they had landed, and where they had something of an
establishment. Here they suffered from the rigors of the Japanese
winter in a wretched hut. They had insufficient food, and received very
small alms. In case of illness, it was impossible to give the sick man
any treatment, or even proper food. The Lord, however, preserved them;
and the tono at last, pitying them and being edified by their way of
living, offered them a town, the income derived from which would
suffice to maintain them. This they declined, as being against the rule
of the province to which they belonged. The king was much amazed, and
gave them some interpreters to speak for them when they preached. Being
on an island seven leguas at sea, they could not preach to advantage,
or learn the language; the king gave them permission to build a house
and a church in the city of Quiodomari. They said their first mass here
on the day of the Visitation of the Virgin Mary in 1606. Here the
fathers made a number of conversions, although they were permitted to
baptize only the common people, the conversion of persons of rank or of
soldiers being forbidden. Some, however, came secretly and were
baptized. One of them, a soldier by the name of Leon, received the
crown of martyrdom in four months.] <span class="pagenum">[<a id=

<h3 class="main">Another mission of the religious to the kingdom of
Camboja</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In Espa&ntilde;a many times the conquest of Camboja,
Sian, and Champan, neighboring kingdoms, was much discussed. The
theologians whom his Majesty consulted declared that this conquest was
justified within certain limitations. As captain-general was appointed
the Conde de Bailen. There came to Manila in 1603 an embassy from the
new king [of Camboja] asking for the friendship of the governor, for a
force of soldiers, and, most important of all, for religious to come
and preach the gospel. The king disclaimed any part in the murders
which had been committed a few years before by the king his predecessor
(who was his nephew), and by the Malay Moros whom that king favored. By
them all the Portuguese and Castilians who were there had been slain,
except one who made his escape.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1106src"
href="#xd21e1106" name="xd21e1106src">37</a> This new king had had
nothing to do with that murder, because he was at the time a prisoner
and captive in Sian, and had been taken from prison there to the
kingdom at the death of his nephew, who had been slain by the Malay
Moros whom he had favored. They had taken possession of the kingdom,
thus rewarding the ungrateful treachery which he had shown to the
Spaniards, although they had restored him to his kingdom. At this time
the governor of these islands was Don Pedro de Acu&ntilde;a, a
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb176" href="#pb176" name=
"pb176">176</a>]</span>man of noble birth and a brave soldier, a
devoted servant of his Majesty, and a true Christian. In this same year
the Lord had given him a glorious victory over fifteen or sixteen
thousand Chinese who attacked this city, of whom scarcely one was left
alive, the Lord aiding this noble gentleman and the few Spaniards who
were in Manila. Not long afterward He gave him the great victory by
which Maluco was recovered and given into the possession of his
Majesty, without the loss of a man, which greatly enhanced the victory.
[The governor was delighted by this embassy from Camboja, and sent to
ask preachers of the order which had spent so much and labored so hard
to introduce the gospel among these tribes. The province immediately
appointed father Fray I&ntilde;igo de Santa Maria as vicar, and, as
associates and apostolic preachers, father Fray Geronimo de
Belen<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1117src" href="#xd21e1117" name=
"xd21e1117src">38</a> and father Fray Alonso Collar, or de Santa
Cathalina&mdash;whom the governor despatched with six Spaniards,
letters, and a present, in a good frigate. They had bad weather, and
were obliged to touch at Cochinchina and to coast along the kingdom of
Champan, where they were attacked by Indians when they went on shore to
get fresh water. They reached the port of Camboja called Chordemuco, in
April. The king received them with great marks of honor, showing
particular favor to the religious. The kingdom was in constant
disturbance, but the king was greatly encouraged even by the presence
of these Spaniards. He was greatly <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb179"
href="#pb179" name="pb179">179</a>]</span>desirous of receiving further
assistance from the Philippinas; but the fathers were doubtful whether
any ought to come, for fear that things would turn out as they had
before. Some vessels came from Cochinchina, the captain of one of them
being one of those Sangleys who had killed the governor of the
Philippinas (Dasmari&ntilde;as); he took possession of the Spanish
galley, and became a pirate. He had at this time the title of
ambassador from the king of Cochinchina. Some of the Japanese knew him,
since he had stolen a ship from them; and they wished to kill him, but
were restrained by the religious. Soon after, when some more Japanese
vessels came into port, they plotted against the man, and took his
life, before the fathers could hinder them. At this time the fathers
and the Spaniards suffered great risks, because the Siamese, the
Chinese, and the Cochin-chinese, and much more the Malay Moros, who
were all assembled here, hate Christianity. There was promise of much
disquiet and many factions; and, to pacify them, the king asked one of
the fathers to go to Manila and to ask for reenforcements of soldiers
and for more fathers, promising to pay the soldiers, who might defend
and guard those who were converted. Father Fray I&ntilde;igo went back
for that purpose. The priests, or bon&ccedil;os, frequented our church
and approved our manner of life, giving hopes of their conversion if
the religious should remain. Some conversions were made, and the manner
of life of the fathers greatly impressed all the people of the city. On
his way back to Manila, father Fray Y&ntilde;igo lost his life. He was
a son of San Estevan at Salamanca, and was almost one of the first who
came to this province, having been sent <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb180" href="#pb180" name="pb180">180</a>]</span>as a result of the
activity of the first bishop of these islands, and of his associate,
Fray Miguel de Venavides. He was a great preacher and very devout in
prayer. He was elected to the priory of Manila, and was most useful in
enlightening the consciences of the inhabitants of that city. He was
most devoted to St. Cecilia and to St. Ursula; and when he called upon
their names, miracles were wrought for him by the supplying of a
convent in Pangasinan with fish at his prayers, and on other occasions.
He showed at some times the spirit of prophecy.</p>
<p>At the same time there died in Camboja father Fray Alonso Collar or
de Sancta Cathalina. Father Fray Alonso was a native of Cangas de
Tineo, and assumed the habit and professed in Oviedo. He had come to
the province in the previous year (1602), and after beginning to learn
the Chinese language, had been sent by the order of his superior on
this expedition. His death caused great grief in Camboja, and his
funeral was attended like that of one of the grandees of the nation.
His bones were afterwards taken to Manila, that he might be buried with
his brethren. Thus there remained in Camboja, in the midst of many and
great perils, one single religious (Jer&oacute;nimo de Bel&eacute;n),
who dared not baptize the people, although he had the license of the
king to do so, because of the confusion and disquiet of the time.
Looking for no future success, and knowing the fickleness of the
Indians of that region&mdash;who had asked to have missionaries and
soldiers sent to them, and who then had received them so ill, and had
finally killed them&mdash;he wrote back asking permission to return;
this was granted him by the provincial, until such time as the affairs
of this kingdom should promise greater stability and quiet.]

<h3 class="main">Some misfortunes which happened at this time, and the
experience of the religious during them</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The city of Manila is the finest and richest of its
size known in all the world. It is of great strength, being almost
surrounded by the sea and by a large river, which wash its walls. It is
the capital and court city of these islands, where the governor and
captain-general of them has his residence, as well as the royal
Audiencia and Chanciller&iacute;a. Here is situated the largest
garrison of soldiers, with its master-of-camp, sargento-mayor, and
captains. From here are sent out the forces and garrisons subject to
this government, which are very many and very wide-spread, for it
includes Maluco and the island of Hermosa&mdash;one of them almost
under the torrid zone, and the other almost within view of Great China
and very near Japon. This city makes the name of Espa&ntilde;a renowned
and feared throughout all these neighboring kingdoms; for, although its
inhabitants and its soldiers are few, yet by the aid of the Lord, whose
faith they spread abroad, they have performed so many glorious exploits
that even the barbarians of the smallest capacity have come to esteem
above measure their greatness, when they see the Spaniards always
victorious over enemies who so surpass them in number that experience
only might make such victories credible. As a kind father with his son,
whose good he desires, not only strives to give him honor and wealth,
but in time provides him with punishment and discipline, therefore,
after our Lord had made the city illustrious with glorious victories
and had filled it with riches, then in the year 1604, at the end of
April, He sent <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb182" href="#pb182" name=
"pb182">182</a>]</span>upon it a fire which, defying all efforts to
control it, burned to the ground a third part of the city&mdash;with
such swiftness that many had no opportunity to escape it (although the
fire occurred about midday), and they perished in the flames; while the
loss of wealth was so great that it can hardly be believed. Hearing the
news of the fire, which was at some distance from our convent, the
religious went to help extinguish it; for on such occasions as this
they labor more and have more confidence than others. In a moment, as
if it were flying, the fire reached our convent; and since there was no
one to protect it, it was almost wholly burnt, the Lord leaving only so
much as was necessary to supply a crowded shelter for the religious,
without being obliged to go to the house of any other person. In this
we were among the more fortunate who escaped; for the fire was so
extensive that others had not even this small comfort. Many who on that
morning were rich, and had great houses and great wealth, had that
night no house where they might lodge or shelter themselves, such is at
times the fury of this terrible element.</p>
<p>At the beginning of October in this same year, this city, and
consequently all the islands, were in great danger of being lost,
because of a revolt against it of the Chinese who lived near it. The
event happened in the following way. In the previous year, in one of
the merchant vessels which come to this city from China every year
there arrived three persons of authority, who are called by the
Spaniards &ldquo;mandarins.&rdquo; These are their judges or leading
officers in war. They entered the city, borne on men&rsquo;s shoulders,
on gilded ivory seats, having the insignia of magistracy: and they were
received with <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb183" href="#pb183" name=
"pb183">183</a>]</span>the display due to ambassadors of so powerful a
king. They had come to search for a mountain which a Chinese, named
Tiongong, had described to his king as being all gold. The name of this
mountain was Cavite, and from it he promised to bring back to China
ships laden with gold. The mandarins made their investigations, for
which purpose they carried Tiongong with them; and when they reached
the place which he described, they found no mountain of gold, nor any
sign of one. When they accused him of fraud and deceit, he answered,
&ldquo;If you wish it to be gold, it is gold&rdquo; (referring to the
ornaments which the Indians wear, and much more to the wealth of the
Spaniards); &ldquo;if you wish it to be sand, it is sand.&rdquo; All
this was done in the sight of the Spaniards, who came there with a good
deal of interest to know the reason why these mandarins had come so far
away from their regular duties&mdash;and especially their chief, who
was, as it were, sargento-mayor of the province of Chincheo, one of the
most prominent officers in their army. The whole thing aroused
suspicion; and the archbishop, Don Fray Miguel de Venavides, a friar of
our habit and a religious of this province, urged the governor to send
them back immediately, that they might not perceive how small a force
the Spaniards had, and might not make the other reconnoissances which
are customary when foreign cities or kingdoms are to be attacked. They
feared that China was intending an attack upon us. The religious of the
order, as they knew the language, visited the mandarins and learned
from them that this Tiongong meant to inform the king that the wealth
of these islands in the hands of Spaniards and Indians <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb184" href="#pb184" name="pb184">184</a>]</span>was
great; and that, if he would send ships and forces, he might easily
make himself lord of it all. They accordingly urged the governor to
hasten sending the mandarins away, and he did so. After this event the
Spaniards did not rest secure, but were very fearful that the king of
China, being a heathen, might be carried away by avarice, and might be
greedy for the great wealth which this trickster offered him. Since he
was a very powerful king, his resources would certainly be greater than
this country could resist without great damage to itself. Even if the
city were to be victorious, the result would be its destruction. It
would lose a great many of its people, and the indignation of the king
would be aroused because of his defeat. He would therefore take away
their commerce from them, without which this country could not be
sustained. All these reasonings and considerations made the Spaniards
very anxious and suspicious. Their suspicions were very greatly
increased when the heathen Chinese kept saying that they believed a
fleet would come the next year. This was heard by some Chinese
Christians who were so in truth; and they went immediately and told it
to our religious who had the direction of them. There were some of them
who put on false hair that they might look like heathen, and went with
studied negligence to the alcaiceria [<i>i.e.</i>, &ldquo;silk
market&rdquo;] where the heathen lived, and heard their conversations
at night with reference to the coming of the fleet. They immediately
reported these things to their religious, and they to the governor and
the archbishop. The archbishop, in a sermon preached at the feast of
the most holy Sacrament in our convent, informed the governor and the
city that they <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb185" href="#pb185" name=
"pb185">185</a>]</span>ought to make preparations, because the Chinese
were about to rebel. Although the governor knew all these things,
because he had been told of them by our religious, on the aforesaid
authority, he could never be persuaded that the Chinese were going to
rebel, because of the great harm and the little or no advantage which
they would receive from the revolt. Yet, to make ready for what might
happen, he began to show special kindness to the Japanese who lived
near Manila, and to prepare them so that in case of necessity they
might be on the side of the Spaniards. He followed the same plan with
the Indians, directing them to prepare themselves with arms and arrows,
to be ready if they should be needed. None of this was conceded from
the Chinese, for it could not be kept secret from so many; and they
even heard with their own ears the most prominent people in Manila say:
&ldquo;We cannot go out against the Chinese, if they come with a fleet,
and leave behind us such a multitude as there is around the city; so,
if we have news that there is a fleet of the Chinese, we shall have to
kill all there are here, and go out and meet those who are
coming.&rdquo; This kind of talk greatly afflicted them; and besides
this, the more ignorant class of people already began to look at them
as enemies, and treated them very badly. The result was that they
became very much disquieted and fearful. In addition, there were not
lacking some to go and tell them lies, bidding them be on their guard,
for on such and such a day the Spaniards were going to break out upon
them. In proof of this lie they called their attention to some facts
which the Sangleys could see&mdash;for instance, that all the Spaniards
were getting ready their weapons, and <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb186" href="#pb186" name="pb186">186</a>]</span>the Indians were
making new ones, though they had no other enemies, unless it were the
Chinese. At last, more out of fear than from any purpose of their own,
they rose in revolt, insomuch that some of them were seen to go where
others had fortified themselves, weeping bitterly because they saw
their destruction, but feeling that there was no other means to save
their lives. The governor and the Audiencia made great efforts to
undeceive them and to pacify them, but nothing that was done gave them
any security. On the contrary, it seemed to them a trick to catch them
unawares. It was a pity to see them leave their houses, which were
many, and flee without knowing where, or considering how they were to
obtain food for so great a multitude. Some of them in this affliction
hanged themselves, to avoid the miseries which as they saw would befall
them if they revolted, and the violent death which they feared if they
did not rise. Finally, on the eve of the glorious St. Francis, they
threw off the mask and came forward as declared rebels against the
city. Sounding warlike music and waving banners, they began to burn
houses and to kill people; and on that night they attacked in a body
the town of Binondo, which is composed of Christians of their own
nation. Their purpose was to force these to join them; but our
religious, to whom the teaching of these Chinese was committed, caused
the women and children to be brought for protection to the church,
while the Chinese Christians took their arms and defended the town
under the leadership of the good knight Don Luis Perez das
Mari&ntilde;as, who lived there next our church. With twenty
arquebusiers, who were on guard in that town, they drove the enemy back
without <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb187" href="#pb187" name=
"pb187">187</a>]</span>suffering any damage. The enemy, however,
inflicted injury upon those who were at work in the fields, many of
whom were taken by surprise and were compelled to join them or to
suffer death. They also attacked the church and town of Tondo, which
belongs to the religious of our father St. Augustine. As the latter had
provided against them by a Spanish guard, they did no harm. After
having defended the town all night, Don Luis das Mari&ntilde;as sent
one of our religious to the governor before daylight, asking for some
troops to attack the Chinese rebels who had fortified themselves near
the town of Tondo, not far from Manila. He was of the opinion that as
these people had spent all the night, disturbed themselves and
disturbing others, they would be tired and sleepy, so that it would be
easy to inflict great losses on them. The governor took the matter
before a council of war; all approved, and he sent his nephew, Don
Thomas de Acu&ntilde;a, with more than a hundred men, the best in the
camp, together with some of the men of highest rank in the city, who
desired to accompany the nephews of the governor and the archbishop,
who went with this party. This small force was regarded as sufficient
to attack more than six thousand who were said to have banded together
and to be in fortifications&mdash;so little did they regard the
Chinese. The Spanish, marching in good order, met at least three
hundred Chinese enemies, and, attacking them, put them immediately to
flight. They were near some large plantations of sugar-cane, in which
the Chinese concealed themselves; and the Spaniards followed them,
being thus divided and brought into disorder. The rebels were posted
not far from there, and, when <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb188"
href="#pb188" name="pb188">188</a>]</span>they saw the Spaniards in
disorder, they all sallied out against them, and, surrounding them,
killed them almost to a man, although with great loss on their own
side. As a result, they plucked up courage to advance against the city,
and to try to make an entry into it. For this purpose they made some
machines of wood, much higher than the wall. They came forward with
these, with no small spirit, but soon lost their courage because,
before the machines were brought into position, they were destroyed by
the artillery, which inflicted much damage upon the enemy. So, after
some slight encounters, they abandoned the siege and fled into the
country. Against them was despatched the sargento-mayor, Christobal de
Azcueta, with as many Spanish soldiers, Indians, and Japanese as could
be got together. As a result of the good order which he maintained, the
Chinese were killed off little by little, until there was not left a
man of them. This was accomplished without any harm to our troops, for,
no matter how much the Chinese strove to force them to give a general
battle, they constantly refused it; but they kept the Chinese in sight
while they were marching, and halted whenever they halted, surrounding
themselves with a palisade of stakes which they carried for the
purpose. These they arranged not in one line, but in two, so that in
case of attack&mdash;and many attacks were made&mdash;before the
Chinese could reach the palisades and pass them, the Spaniards with
their arquebuses and arrows killed the greater number of them. The loss
of life was especially great among the most courageous, who led the
van; while the rest turned back in terror, without effecting anything.
Hunger also fought with them powerfully, because, as our <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb189" href="#pb189" name=
"pb189">189</a>]</span>soldiers kept them constantly under
surveillance, they could not go aside to forage. The little food which
they had brought from Manila was quickly exhausted; and, after that was
gone, their lives followed rapidly. Thus by the twentieth of October
the war was at an end and everything was quiet. But the city was
greatly in need of all sorts of things, for all the trades were in the
hands of the Chinese, and, now that they were dead, there was no
shoemaker, or tailor, or dealer in provisions, or any other necessary
tradesman; and there was no hope that they would come again to this
country for trade and commerce. On this account it was determined to
send an embassy to China, to give information as to the facts of the
case. There were appointed as ambassadors Captain Marcos de la Cueba
and father Fray Luis Gandullo, one of our religious&mdash;a man of
great virtue, sanctity, and prudence, who had gone to China on two
other occasions. They suffered much hardship on the voyage, but finally
succeeded in their negotiations with the viceroy of the province of
Chincheo, which is the place from which the Chinese come to Manila.
After he had given them license to get a supply of ammunition for the
city, he dismissed them, promising to continue the trade. This promise
was carried into effect, for in the following year there came thirteen
ships; and from that day forward everything has gone on as if nothing
of what has been narrated had ever taken place. <span class=

<h3 class="main">The election as provincial of father Fray Miguel de
San Jacintho and the coming of religious</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">On May 9, 1604, father Fray Juan de Santo Thomas
having completed his term as provincial, there was elected in his place
father Fray Miguel de San Jacintho, a religious of much prudence, great
virtue, and a mind greatly inclined to goodness, and one who loved and
honored those who were good. He exhibited in the course of his office
great talent in governing, watching over the order with great care, and
filling his office with much affability and simplicity, which caused
the religious to love him, and to feel particular satisfaction in him
because they had shown so much wisdom in appointing him as superior of
the province, out of all the many candidates who had been put forward
at that election. His excellent and prudent manner of governing was not
displayed on this occasion for the first time; for he had previously
exhibited his high abilities in such offices when he was elected by his
associates as their superior on the journey from Espa&ntilde;a, that
position having been vacated by the death in Mexico of father Fray
Alonso Delgado, who had come as their vicar. In spite of the youth of
father Fray Miguel, he filled this office so much to the satisfaction
of all that they regarded themselves as fortunate in having found a
superior who looked out so carefully for the advantage of every one
without ever forgetting the general good of the order&mdash;which, as
being more universal, takes precedence and commands higher esteem. In
the affairs of the voyage, which are many and full of difficulty, he
conducted himself so <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb191" href="#pb191"
name="pb191">191</a>]</span>well and anticipated them with such
accuracy that it seemed as if all of his life had been spent in the
office of conducting religious. This is a function that calls for many
diverse qualities, difficult to find united in a single person unless
he is a man of so superior a nature as was father Fray Miguel. When he
arrived in the province, they sent him to the district of Nueva
Segovia. Here he was one of the first missionaries and founders of this
conversion; and was one of the best and most careful, most beloved by
the Indians, and most devoted to his duties as a religious, who had
ever been in that province. He suffered all the hardships and
necessities, the poverty and the lack of sustenance, which have been
recounted. From them, although he was a man of strong constitution and
fitted to endure much, the want and the lack of food resulted in
causing severe pains of the stomach. This evidently resulted from
hunger, for as soon as he had a moderate amount of food he was well;
but this happened seldom, and most of the time they had nothing to eat
but some wild herbs which they gathered in the fields, and which were
more suited to purge their stomachs than to sustain their lives. Hence
in jest father Fray Gaspar Zarfate, who was his associate, said to him
that he was greatly in doubt whether they were properly keeping the
fasts prescribed by the constitutions, because they ate the same thing
for supper in the evening as for dinner at noon; for, as they had
nothing else, they ate quilites at noon for dinner, and quilites at
night for supper. There were received at this chapter the church and
house of Nuestra Se&ntilde;ora del Rosario [<i>i.e.</i>, &ldquo;Our
Lady of the Rosary&rdquo;] in the kingdom of Satzuma in Japon; and,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb192" href="#pb192" name=
"pb192">192</a>]</span>in the province of Nueva Segovia, those of San
Vicente in Tocolano, San Miguel in Nasiping, San Pedro in Tuguegarao,
San Raymundo in Lobo, Sancta Ynes de Monte Policiano in Pia, Santa
Cathalina de Sena in Nabunanga (which is now in the village of Yguig),
and Nuestra Se&ntilde;ora de la Asuncion [&ldquo;Our Lady of the
Assumption&rdquo;] in Talama. These were all villages which had been
waiting for religious; and as the bishop of that region, Don Fray Diego
de Soria, a religious of the order and of this province, had written
that he was about to come back to it with a large following of
religious, the new provincial was encouraged to take the charge of so
many new churches and villages which were so much in need of teaching,
for they had never had any, and were nearly all heathen. The good
bishop did not fail of his promise. He had been one of the first and
most prominent founders of this province, had seen and passed through
the great sufferings which the establishment of it required, and had
likewise had his share in the great harvest which the religious had
reaped in these regions. He therefore loved it much, and strove with
all his might to increase it; and hence, when he was about to come to
his bishopric, he endeavored to bring with him a goodly number of
excellent religious. The vicar in charge of them was father Fray
Bernabe de Reliegos, a son of the distinguished convent of San Pablo at
Valladolid, where in the course of time he went after some years to
die, leaving the religious highly edified by his happy death, which was
to be expected from his very devoted life. The example which they gave
on the way from their convents to Sevilla was such that it highly
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb193" href="#pb193" name=
"pb193">193</a>]</span>edified the people of the towns through which
they passed. The religious who set out from San Pablo at Valladolid
were four in number, and they made their way to the port on foot,
asking alms and sustaining themselves solely by what the Lord gave to
them as to His poor. Although on some occasions they suffered from need
because there was no one to give them sufficient alms, they never made
use of the money which the superior had sent them for the
journey&mdash;esteeming more highly that which was given them for the
love of God, and putting aside the shame which begging alms at the
doors brings with it. They came to a small hamlet in the Sierra Morena,
and, though they went two by two to search for lodgings, they found
none, and still less did they find any food. Hence in their need, which
was great because they had gone on foot, they went to find the alcalde,
to lay their necessities before him. After he had several times refused
to see them, he at last admitted them at night, and sent them to a
house with orders that they should receive the friars. A gentleman from
Baeca was there, who, seeing that they were poor, had compassion upon
them and sent a page to invite them to eat dinner, although he had
already dined before the religious could reach the house. They thanked
him for these alms, but declined them, saying that the alcalde of the
town had provided for their dinner and lodging; and the gentleman sent
them forty reals in charity, saying that he did not send them more
because he was journeying on business to the court, where the expenses
were so great that they left him no more with which he could help the
friars, as he wished to do. That the Lord permits such needs is not due
to His lack of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb194" href="#pb194" name=
"pb194">194</a>]</span>power or of love, and He ordinarily makes up for
them with similar or greater recompenses. In Baylen they went around
the town two by two, and when they had all come together, without
obtaining more than two or three cuartos in alms, night came upon them
without any inn or lodging. A man was following their path who had
noticed what happened to them, and he offered them his house. They
thanked him, and accepted his charity; but the house was nothing but a
poor peddler&rsquo;s shed, three brazas long and two wide, and, that he
might take them in, he sent his wife that night to sleep elsewhere. But
a house of charity could not fail to be large and spacious, and hence
the religious rested in it with much satisfaction and joy. In the
morning the Lord paid the charitable host for the lodging; for the
conde, learning of what had happened, called him to appear in presence
of the religious, thanked him for what he had done, and, promising him
his favor for the future, forced a man who had done our host some
wrong, some days before, to recompense him for it immediately. Thus he
went away happier than if it had been a feast day, though this is not
the principal pay for such works, for they earn glory in the sight of
God. All the religious reached Sevilla, and set sail on St.
John&rsquo;s day in a small vessel to go to Cadiz and take ship. At
noon they were at a considerable distance from land, and the master of
the ship was very inattentive. The religious saw three vessels with
lateen sails following them, and were amused at these because they had
never seen that kind of sail before. This called the attention of the
master, and he went up and looked at them. Seeing that they were
Moorish vessels, he trimmed his <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb195"
href="#pb195" name="pb195">195</a>]</span>sails, and turning the helm,
set out to run ashore. When he succeeded, he said: &ldquo;Some saint is
sailing in this boat, on whose account our Lord has delivered us today
from falling into the hands of Moors; for it is they who were chasing
us with their light sails and swift boats, from which it was impossible
that this heavy bark with its heavy load should have escaped, if some
superior power had not been watching over us by some saint who has been
traveling with your Reverences.&rdquo; On the following day it was
learned that at that very same place some people who had taken the same
voyage had been captured, wherefore they saw themselves obliged anew to
render most humble thanks to the Lord for His singular mercy and
kindness. They went on board the ships; and when the fleet was sailing
in the gulf which on account of its restlessness and the many waves
which are always there, is called Golfo de las Yeguas [<i>i.e.</i>,
&ldquo;Gulf of the Mares&rdquo;], two sailors fell overboard from the
flagship&mdash;an accident which often happens when they are working in
confusion at a critical moment. The flagship&mdash;not being able to
help them, since it was carried on and separated from them by the
wind&mdash;gave a signal, by discharging a piece, to the ships that
followed it that they should try to pick up the men. As none of the
other ships was able to go to their help, that one on which were the
bishop and the religious hove to; but, on account of the excitement of
the moment, they failed to do so with proper caution and prudence. The
rudder was brought over with all the sails up so that the head of the
ship was brought down dangerously, and the whole bow as far back as the
foremast went under water. That there might not be one accident only,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb196" href="#pb196" name=
"pb196">196</a>]</span>the violence of the wind and the burden of the
sails and the force of the waves jerked the tiller
[<i>pin&ccedil;ote</i>] from those who were at the helm, and swung it
across fast under the biscuit hatchway, leaving the ship without means
to steer it when that was most needed. The hatchway was closed, and no
key was to be found. The ship was going to the bottom, being submerged
in the water, and the waves, which were like mountains, were beating on
its sides, so that the mariners in alarm were shouting, &ldquo;We are
lost, we are going to the bottom and cannot help ourselves, for want of
a rudder and direction.&rdquo; &ldquo;Let us turn,&rdquo; said the
bishop, &ldquo;to our Mother and Lady, the mother of God, and let us
promise to fast in her honor for three days on bread and water if by
her help we may receive our lives.&rdquo; The religious did so, and,
falling down in prayer, they supplicated her for aid; and
instantly&mdash;a proper work for the divine pity and that of the
Mother of Compassion&mdash;the tiller, or stem of the rudder, came out,
of itself, from the hole into which it had gone. This was contrary to
the common expectation in the ordinary course of similar cases; for the
hole was very small, and therefore it was very difficult for anything
which had once entered it to be brought back again. Four men quickly
caught it, and, bringing it across with great strength, turned the ship
back into its course. The seamen were in amazement at this
extraordinary event; and, as they had had experience in like cases,
they regarded it as the favor and benefit of our Lady who had been
invoked by her afflicted and unhappy chaplains. Therefore to her the
religions rendered devout and humble thanks, and with great joy
fulfilled the vow which they had made. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb197" href="#pb197" name="pb197">197</a>]</span></p>
<p>On its voyage the fleet touched at the island of Guadalupe for wood
and water. This island was inhabited by a barbarous and inhuman race,
bare of any sort of clothing, and (what is worse) bare of any sort of
pity; for they had no pity upon those who, without doing them any harm,
came there to get water which would be wasted in the sea, and wood for
which they had no use whatsoever. There were in the fleet the
Marqu&eacute;s de Montes Claros, going to be viceroy of Nueva
Espa&ntilde;a, and, as commander, Don Fulgencio de Meneses y Toledo;
and on the eve of our father St. Dominic, twenty-five soldiers having
gone ashore as a guard with an ensign in command, all those on board
the fleet went ashore and mass was said as the religious had desired.
After that, the religious and all the rest went to wash their clothes
and to bathe themselves, of which there was great need. The sailors
went to get wood and water. Being all more widely scattered than was
proper, they failed to keep a proper lookout, when they ought to have
been more on their guard against the peril which menaced them. The
islanders, taking advantage of the opportunity to carry out their evil
purpose, came down close to them, being hidden in the thick undergrowth
of the mountain. They began to shoot arrows at the Spaniards when the
Spaniards were not keeping a lookout, and when they themselves had the
advantage. This they did so rapidly and in such numbers that it seemed
as if it rained arrows. When the Indians were perceived many were
already wounded, and much blood had been shed. The surprise and
confusion threw the crew into a panic, and huddling together in a
frightened group they fled, each man striving to put himself
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb198" href="#pb198" name=
"pb198">198</a>]</span>in safety&mdash;one leaping into the boat to go
back to the ship; another throwing himself into the sea, which was then
regarded as more pitiful than the land; still another hiding himself
among the trees and letting the savages pass as they shot their arrows
at those whom they found ahead of them, and letting them pick up as
spoils the clothes which he had been washing, or which were now being
dried after the washing. Those who could do least to resist the attack
of the islanders were the religious; and hence many of them fell
wounded and others dead, for it was easier to draw their souls from
them than to draw out the arrows. Three of them hid themselves in a
thicket, where the Lord delivered them from a shower of arrows which
were shot after them as they went to hide. Holding a little [image of]
Christ in their hands, they begged him earnestly that he would blind
the savages that they might not see them and might pass them by. The
Lord heard them, and thus, though the islanders saw them hide
themselves and shot many arrows after them, yet the arrows did not
strike them; and the Indians, who are keener than mastiffs in
discovering people, could not find them, though they passed the place
where they were.</p>
<p>The wounded were: father Fray Juan Luis de Guete, a son of the
convent of Preachers in Valencia, in whose spine an arrow was fastened,
being stopped by the bone; father Fray Juan Naya, a son of the convent
of San Pedro Martyr at Calatayud, who escaped with a wound in his arm
where an arrow had passed through it; and father Fray Jacintho Calvo,
who was struck twice. He was a son of the convent of La Pe&ntilde;a de
Francia, where in course of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb199" href=
"#pb199" name="pb199">199</a>]</span>time he hung up one of the arrows.
The wounds were not so penetrating as to take their lives; but they
made the fathers very happy because here, with this blessed beginning,
they had begun to shed their blood for the Lord who had redeemed them
with His own, and for the gospel which they were going to preach in His
service. The religious who died there were six. They were so picked and
selected among all the rest that, as they were the cream of all the
others, it was plain that that which the islanders had done <i>en
masse</i> was, so far as concerned the Lord, a most particular
providence of His who had directed the arrows against the best and the
ripest of the religious that they might be offered as early fruit on
the table of the supreme Father, as something in which one may safely
assert that He takes much pleasure. Three of these holy martyrs were
children of the most religious convent of Preachers in Valencia, which,
as it is so prolific in saints, naturally had here the greater share.
The first was father Fray Juan de Moratalla, a native of Murcia, a
religious of noble example, great mortification, silence, modesty, and
composure. [He was devoted to prayer and solitude, and to the good of
others. The second was father Fray Vicente Palao Valenciano, a
religious very precise in his observance of the rules, and such as a
priest ought to be. The third was Fray Juan Martinez, a priest, an
Aragonese, a religious of purest and holiest life. The fourth was Fray
Juan Cano, a native of Burgo de Osma, a son of San Pablo de Valladolid,
young in age, old in virtue. The fifth religious was Fray Pedro Moreno,
a deacon, a native of Villalba, a son of the royal convent of Sancta
Cruz at Segovia, and <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb200" href="#pb200"
name="pb200">200</a>]</span>a member of the most illustrious college of
San Gregorio at Valladolid. He was devoted to prayer and to silent
meditation. At his death the Lord wrought a miracle by enabling him to
make his way to the seashore, where he died in prayer, and was
afterward found beneath the water in the attitude of prayer. The sixth
religious was Fray Jacintho de Cistenes, a son of the convent at
Valencia, and a native of that noble city. He was young in age but
venerable for his virtue. The Lord had revealed to him that he should
die on the day of St. Lawrence, as he actually did, after suffering for
some time from his mortal wound.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1201src"

<p class="first">The religious who were coming to the province,
although they had been diminished in number by the savages of
Guadalupe, were of great use. They were fourteen in number, and, that
they might immediately begin that which they had sought over so many
seas and through so many hardships, they were assigned to their duties.
The newly-elected provincial took with him four for the province of
Nueva Segovia, where at that time the conversions were going on
rapidly, because the country was large and nearly all the inhabitants
were heathen. When they reached the cape known as Cabo del Bojeador, a
place which is ordinarily a difficult one, the provincial saw that a
small cloud which covered the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb201"
href="#pb201" name="pb201">201</a>]</span>peaks of some mountains near
there was moving toward the sea, which began to be unquiet and rough.
The pilot thought it best that the sails should be lowered somewhat, in
order better to resist the attack of the wind and the waves which
threatened them. While he was striving to do this, the tempest
anticipated him; and the wind came with such force that wind and wave
turned the vessel on its side, and the water entered over the sides of
the ship. It was necessary for the religious to put their hands to the
oars, while the rest went to work, with great difficulty, to get in the
sails&mdash;nothing being left but the courses, in order to make it
possible to steer. Although the amount of sail was so small, the wind
was so powerful that, lifting the vessel on one side, it forced the
other under the water. The religious repeated the exorcisms against the
tempest, upon which it subsided a little; but when the exorcism was
completed it came back with as much force as at first, almost capsizing
the vessel, and making it ship water. When the exorcism was renewed,
the tempest moderated itself anew; but when the exorcism was completed,
its fury returned as before. Thus they perceived that this tempest was
not merely a tempest of wind and of waves, but was aided by the
devil&mdash;who at the words of the exorcism lost his strength, and as
soon as that ceased received it again, to hinder the ministers of the
gospel. Four times they repeated the exorcism, and four times the same
thing happened, upon which the father provincial, recognizing the
author of this evil, said: &ldquo;Since I see that ministers are to be
given to the villages of the heathen, and that the devil, who unjustly
keeps them under his tyranny, is about to be banished from <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb202" href="#pb202" name=
"pb202">202</a>]</span>them, I promise to build a church under the
patronage of the guardian angels, that they may aid us against this
cursed enemy who is so clearly making war against us.&rdquo; As soon as
he had made this promise, it seemed that the guardian angels took upon
themselves the protection of the fragata; for the tornado began to
disappear, and they continued their voyage. On the following day they
rounded the cape, by rowing against a slight contrary wind which had
arisen; and when this wind had quieted down, the fragata came to some
billows where a number of opposing currents met. The waves were so high
that the little boat put its side under water. A religious threw into
the sea some relics of St. Raymond, repeating the glories of the saint,
and the sea was immediately calmed&mdash;just as when water boils too
violently in the kettle, and a little water is poured into it; and by
the kindness of the saint a fair wind was given to them, with which
they continued their voyage.</p>
<p>When they reached Nueva Segovia, a minister was provided for the
village of Nasiping, which had been accepted ten years before, but for
which it had been impossible previously to provide a minister because
the supply of them was so scanty. Even now there was so much requiring
the attention of the religious, and they were so few, that half a
miracle was necessary for the missionary to be given. Father Fray
Francisco de la Cruz, or Jurado,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1220src"
href="#xd21e1220" name="xd21e1220src">40</a> was taken dangerously ill.
He was a religious of much virtue, of whom they had great hopes. The
father provincial, fearing to lose him, promised to give a minister to
Nasiping if the sick man recovered. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb203" href="#pb203" name="pb203">203</a>]</span>Father Fray Francisco
recovered, and the provincial fulfilled his vow and named the church
after St. Michael. This village is on the banks of the great river
[<i>i.e.</i>, of Cagay&aacute;n], five or six leguas higher up than the
city of the Spaniards. In the year 1625, twenty-one years after it
received ministers, there had been baptized in it more than three
thousand four hundred persons, as is certified by the baptismal
records; and, in addition to this, many were baptized in sickness who,
because of their immediate death, were not entered on the records. To
this village there came an Indian from Tuguegarao, which is distant two
days&rsquo; journey by water. He very earnestly desired the religious
to confess him, and to give him the other holy sacraments. The
religious confessed him and gave him the communion, more that he might
assist his devotion than because he supposed he was in danger. He had
come on foot and seemed strong, so that it seemed that he was very far
from being in such a state of necessity; but after he had received the
sacrament he died. This was something at which the religious wondered,
and which aroused in him great devotion and joy when with his eyes he
saw so plainly the power of divine predestination, carried out in ways
so hidden and mysterious. Father Fray Pedro Muriel,<a class="noteref"
id="xd21e1228src" href="#xd21e1228" name="xd21e1228src">41</a> who is
still living, has testified as an eye-witness that when he was minister
in that village, in the year 1631, the locusts were more in number than
the natives had ever seen before. In the fields of that village they
were in such numbers that they spread over a space <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb204" href="#pb204" name=
"pb204">204</a>]</span>three leguas in length and a quarter of a legua
in breadth, covering the earth and the trees so that the ground could
not be seen, so thickly did they cover it; and they ravaged the fields
as if they had been burnt. [The Indians did what they could to frighten
away the locusts, but in vain; and the Lord heard the prayers of one of
the Indians that He would drive away the locusts during the night. At
dawn, when he expected to find all of his fields desolated, he found
that just half of them had been eaten, and that all the rest had been
left. The Lord showed a similar grace to a poor woman who prayed for
His aid in protecting her field of maize.]</p>
<p>In this same year, 1604, the provincial sent three religious to the
estuary of Lobo and the country of Ytabes,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e1235src" href="#xd21e1235" name="xd21e1235src">42</a> in the
province of Nueva Segovia. All those Indians are heathen; and though by
nature they are very tractable and easy to deal with, simple and free
from malice, and concerned with nothing but their agriculture, still
the outrages of those who took tribute from them were so great that
they enraged the natives and obliged them to take up arms, to the great
loss of the Spaniards<span class="corr" id="xd21e1244" title=
"Not in source">.</span> As they were few and the multitude of the
Indians many, the few, although they were very courageous, came to
their death by the hands of the many; or, rather, the unjust came to
death by the hands of divine justice, which in this way was pleased to
chastise and end their injustices. And as we very seldom reckon
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb205" href="#pb205" name=
"pb205">205</a>]</span>rightly, the chastisement which God wrought by
the hands of these Indians was attributed by the Spaniards to the
courage and valor of this tribe; and thus they were very fearful of
them until the holy gospel declared by the Dominican religious changed
them from bloodthirsty wolves to gentle sheep&mdash;the Lord aiding by
manifest miracles to give credit to His faith and to His ministers, to
the end that they might be able to do that which without this or
similar assistance from the Lord it would have been impossible to
achieve. One of the three religious who entered these heathen villages
to undertake their conversion said, in giving an account of what
happened: &ldquo;Since the hand of the Lord has been so plainly
succoring these Indians by the hands of those religious who dwelt among
them, their reformation has been great and marvelous. They have gone
from one extreme to the other, almost without any intermediate stage,
since the religious took them under their care. Before that they were
so free, so completely without God or law, without king or any person
to respect, that they gave themselves up freely to their desires and
their passions. Evidence of this is found in those wars which they were
continually waging among themselves, without plan or order; and in the
drunkenness and the outrages of which they were guilty, without regard
to God or man. He who was most esteemed among them was the greatest
drunkard, because, as he was the richest, he could obtain the most
liquor. He who slew the greatest number of men was regarded as superior
to all the rest. They married and unmarried daily, with one or many
wives. In a word, they were a barbarous race, given up to all sorts of
shameless conduct. In <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb206" href=
"#pb206" name="pb206">206</a>]</span>spite of all this, when the
missionary came among them they were as docile as if they had during
all their lives been learning to obey, which is something very
difficult even in religious orders. This was true, although the
religious instantly laid a general interdict upon all their ancient
vices; obliged them to consort solely with their lawful wives; even
forced many to abandon their land and their old villages, that they
might come where teaching was given them; and, in a word, compelled
them to enter all at once, and in a body, into ordered ways of living,
in matters both divine and human. They had not a thought of opposing a
single command; and this has been achieved without stripes or
penalties, but simply by kindness and gentleness. The result has been
that those who did not understand anything except killing, and drinking
till they could not stand, and running without any restraint after
every sort of vice, now never think of doing these things&mdash;as I
have seen in these first three villages in this district of Ytabes. The
day we went among them we found all the men lying about the streets,
dead drunk; since that day there has not been one drunk enough to lose
his senses. The same reformation has been achieved in all other
matters, for they were not compelled to do all this by fear of the
Spaniards. Quite otherwise; the Spaniards regarded these Indians as so
indomitable and intrepid that, for fear of them, they did not dare go
up the river as far as their villages; but after the religious went
among them, they were gathered into large villages that they might be
more easily instructed in the faith, having been previously scattered
among many small ones, like so many farmsteads [in Spain]. There were
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb207" href="#pb207" name=
"pb207">207</a>]</span>three villages thus formed: one of about five
hundred tributes, named Taban, the church of which was called San
Raymundo; and the other two of more than a thousand tributes
each&mdash;one called Pia, its church Santa Ynes de Monte Policiano,
afterwards known as San Domingo; and the last one, named Tuao, the
church of which was dedicated to the holy guardian angels because of
the incident referred to above. Thus all those people were brought
together and united, to reduce them to settlements, and to a civilized
mode of life and government; and to the church; but this result was
obtained at no small cost to the religious. Of three of them, two
immediately fell very sick, and the third still more so, for he died as
a result of the illness. This was father Fray Luis de Yllescas, a son
of the convent of Sancto Domingo at Mexico, a very humble religious,
very obedient and beloved by all. He received the holy sacraments for
his departure with great devotion; and went away to enjoy, as may be
presumed, the reward of his labors, which had been many in a short
time. Yet neither this death nor the failure of health in the rest
caused them to withdraw their hands from the work upon which they had
begun. On the contrary, the great good which they beheld, wrought by
the Lord among these Indians, served as medicines and remedies for the
ills from which they suffered; and for their convalescence, though they
had no worldly luxuries, that fruit was much better which, more and
more every day, was borne by this new plant of the church. From it they
recovered health, strength, and new courage to carry on the work which
they had begun. To give them still greater spirit, the Lord came to
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb208" href="#pb208" name=
"pb208">208</a>]</span>them working miracles. The first mass which was
celebrated in the village of Pia took place on St. Bartholomew&rsquo;s
day, the twenty-fourth of August. [Before the end of the month, a sick
person who wished to be baptised beheld some <span class="corr" id=
"xd21e1256" title="Source: firce">fierce</span> and abominable forms
which dissuaded him from baptism, and reminded him of the rights and
customs of his ancestors, charging him not to change the faith in which
his fathers and grandfathers had lived. These dreadful forms were
driven away by three persons, clad in black cloaks with white garments
beneath. The sick man was often asked if he knew these three persons
who had delivered him, and he said &ldquo;no.&rdquo; When he was asked
if they were religious of our order he also said &ldquo;no,&rdquo;
because he had never seen any of the religious wearing their cloaks. He
always declared that he had been awake and not asleep; and the
narrative was accepted as certain. At one time, a religious who was
himself in poor health was left in charge of thirteen newly-converted
Christians, who were all confined to their beds by sickness. Being
unable to give them the care which he desired, he placed upon the
abdomen of each of them a little roasted rice-bran, very hot, begging
the Lord to make up by His pity for the lack of medicine. When he came
back the next day to visit them, all but two were well, and had gone to
work in the field; and the others soon recovered. The same treatment
given by another Indian or by the sick man to himself had no effect;
and thus it is plain that the healing was due to the desire of the Lord
to honor and to give authority to the hand which applied the remedy.
The Indians themselves observed that, after they had religious, far
fewer died than before they <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb209" href=
"#pb209" name="pb209">209</a>]</span>had them. In their ancient days of
superstition, when a man fell sick he generally died, because he was
treated only by the witchcraft of the aniteras, whose sole purpose was
to get gold from the sick persons by false promises. The sorcerers did
them no good and indeed rather harmed them, since cures came from our
worst enemy, the devil; while now the Lord was giving them, by means of
the religious, health that was health indeed. One of the religious in
this region, father Fray Juan Naya,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1261src"
href="#xd21e1261" name="xd21e1261src">43</a> fell ill, and grew worse
so rapidly that he was given up as a consumptive. By the advice of
another religious, he made a vow to our Lady to serve in that province
among the heathen, if she should be pleased to grant him sufficient
health for him to carry on this work. He made the vow for seven
consecutive years from the day of the Visitation, July 2, 1605. During
all this time he had his health; but at the end of the seven years he
was attacked by a very severe and dangerous illness, which left him
when he renewed his vow for four years more. Similar experiences have
been frequent among the religious. It has even happened to some who
were not very devoted to this work, and who desired to go to other
provinces where the Lord might be served with less severity and with
somewhat greater comfort, that they have been afflicted with diseases,
which gave place to miraculous health as soon as they made vows to
remain and minister to the Indians whom they wished to leave. In this
region the Lord manifested His goodness and gave authority to his
ministers, curing a sick woman <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb210"
href="#pb210" name="pb210">210</a>]</span>who was at the point of
death, by means of the sacrament of holy baptism. In this same village
it happened to father Fray Juan Naya that a poisonous snake entered his
shoe without any evil effect. An Indian in this same village called
upon God in his illness, and, when it did not seem good to the divine
Providence to heal him, he called upon the devil whom he had previously
served. The Lord punished him with dreadful visions, from which he was
delivered upon praying to the Lord for His protection; and he was
finally cured, after making his confession. A child was miraculously
healed in the town of Pia at the time when father Fray Juan Sancta Ana
was vicar there. A woman who did not seem to be dangerously ill prayed
so earnestly to be baptized that the father granted her wish. She died
almost immediately after, the Lord having shown her a marvelous
kindness in causing the religious to baptize her immediately.]</p>

<h3 class="main">What our Lord wrought, by the intercession of our Lady
of the Rosary, who stands in a shrine between the two villages of Pia
and Tuao.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">[In the church of the village of Pia there was an
image of our Lady on one of the side altars. It had been made in Macan,
and had been first set up in the church of our order in the city of
Nueva Segovia, whence it was taken to the church of Pia. Here the image
was greatly beloved; and when father Fray Juan de Sancta Ana gave it
away to another village, after having received a second image of much
greater beauty, the people begged so earnestly to have it returned that
the vicar was obliged to have another painted on canvas and sent to the
village of Tuguegarao <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb211" href=
"#pb211" name="pb211">211</a>]</span>(to which he had given the one for
which the Indians begged), and to have the first image brought back.
While the father was considering where it would best be put, the idea
occurred to him that it would be well to establish a shrine on the road
between Pia and Tuao, at a distance of about a league and a half from
each of the towns. This shrine was set up on St. Stephen&rsquo;s day in
1623. On the day on which the shrine was consecrated more than ten
thousand persons were gathered together from the neighboring villages.
One of the women of the highest rank in the village of Pia undertook
the care of the shrine, placing a lamp to burn constantly before the
holy image. This Indian was named Do&ntilde;a Ynes Maguilabun. The
Virgin was not slow to reward her for this devotion, for once when
Do&ntilde;a Ynes took with her to the shrine her little nephew, a child
of five years, who was suffering from a large swelling under his left
arm&mdash;a disease among the Indians which runs into an abscess, and,
being so near the heart, is very dangerous indeed, because of the lack
of medicines and of medical science among these Indians&mdash;the
little one was left in the shrine, and fell asleep on the steps of the
altar. While there he had a vision of the Virgin, and, when he awoke,
the swelling was entirely healed. Other miracles were wrought by the
same image. One particularly worthy of mention happened in the year
1624. There being a severe drouth, the father who was at that time in
the village of Tuao, Fray Andres de Haro,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e1275src" href="#xd21e1275" name="xd21e1275src">44</a>
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb212" href="#pb212" name=
"pb212">212</a>]</span>and father Fray Juan de Sancta Ana, decided to
make some processions and offer prayers to the Lord for His mercy. They
accordingly arranged to make processions on a certain day from each of
the villages to the shrine. The Indians of Pia confessed their sins,
that the burden of them might be removed from the land; and on that
same Sunday it rained so copiously in the region of this village of Pia
that it seemed as if the village would be drowned and as if the
floodgates of heaven were open. On the day appointed for the
processions, the father of the village of Pia told the Indians that it
was not necessary to make the procession, but that he would say a
solemn mass of thanks to our Lady, which could be done in the church.
They, however, insisted; and when they reached the shrine they found
there all the people of the village of Tuao, where not a drop of rain
had fallen, because the inhabitants of Tuao had not thought of
confessing. They immediately began to prepare themselves for
confession, and all that day the inhabitants of Tuao and Pia confessed
their sins, revealing some which, from lack of faith, or pusillanimity,
or shame, they had concealed. When they reached home in the evening it
began to rain in both villages and in all the fields around them; and
it rained so hard that it was impossible to bring back the ornaments
which had been taken to the shrine for the saying of mass. On several
other occasions our Lady showed mercy by granting rain in answer to the
prayers of those who besought it before this holy image.] <span class=

<h3 class="main">The venerable father Fray Miguel de Venavides, one of
the first founders of this province and archbishop of Manila.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Among the great kindnesses and benefits which our
province, and indeed all these islands, have received from the Lord,
one of the greatest was His having given them father Fray Miguel de
Venavides as one of the first who came to establish this province of
the Holy Rosary, and as second archbishop of this city. At a time when
its inhabitants suffered great tribulations, and found themselves
suddenly besieged by a number of enemies much larger than their
own&mdash;enemies from within their houses and their homes&mdash;they
found in him a true father for their consolation, and a prelate
acceptable to God, who could placate His ire by interceding for his
people. He was born in Carrion de Los Condes, of noble parents, well
known in that region because of their descent and their virtue. When he
was not more than fifteen years old he assumed the habit of this
religious order, and learned by experience how true is the saying of
the Holy Spirit that it is well for a man to carry the easy yoke of the
service of God from his youth. He received the habit and professed in
the distinguished convent of San Pablo at Valladolid. He immediately
began to display the subtilty of his mind, which was very great; at the
very beginning of his studies he seemed like an eagle soaring above his
fellow-pupils, distinguishing himself by special marks or acuteness, so
that most of the students and the learned were astonished. He was,
accordingly, soon made a member of the college <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb214" href="#pb214" name="pb214">214</a>]</span>of
San Gregorio in that city, a crucible in which is refined the metal of
the finest intellects which the order has in the provinces of
Espa&ntilde;a and Andalucia. Here he had as master him who of right was
the master of the theology of Espa&ntilde;a&mdash;the most learned
father Fray Domingo Ba&ntilde;ez. The two were so completely suited to
each other in virtue and ability that father Fray Miguel could not fail
to be the beloved disciple of such a master. So much did the great
teacher love him that, when he saw him advance so far in both virtue
and ability, he was accustomed to say <i lang="la">Hic est discipulus
ille</i> [<i>i.e.</i>, &ldquo;This is that disciple&rdquo;], giving him
by antonomasia the name of his disciple, out of the many, whom he
regarded with so great praise. He taught the arts in his convent, and
theology in many houses of the province; and finally returned to be
lecturer in theology in his convent of San Pablo. It was while he was
engaged in this duty and exercise that he was taken captive by the
voice of father Fray Juan Chrisostomo, who was seeking for religious
for the foundation of the province of the Holy Rosary in the
Philippinas. The province was to be founded for the conversion of the
many heathen who were in those islands, and for the purpose of entering
upon the preaching of the gospel in the most populous kingdom of China,
if the Lord should open the door to it, as well as in that of Japon and
the other kingdoms neighboring to the said islands. Being seized by a
fervent desire and a holy zeal for the redemption of the souls of the
many heathen in these islands, he gave up his position as lecturer, and
the honors and degrees which were waiting for him; and esteeming it a
higher task to labor for Christ and for his fellow men he made
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb215" href="#pb215" name=
"pb215">215</a>]</span>up his mind to go with those who were preparing
for this holy journey. The Lord thus ordained because of the serious
problems which were to be met, in which his character, ability,
knowledge, and talents would be very necessary to overcome the many
obstacles which confronted this holy foundation as soon as its founders
reached Nueva Espa&ntilde;a, and also in the royal court and in the
Roman court; for in all these places there were many impediments.
Against all of them father Fray Miguel was the defender of truth; and
by his speeches and writings he came off always victor. Afterward, when
the difficulty which was met with in Mexico was overcome, he came, with
the rest of the fathers who founded the province, to the city of Manila
on the day of the apostle St. James; and on the day of our father St.
Dominic, which came immediately afterward, he presided in the great
church over some theological discussions. This he did to the admiration
of his listeners, who were not accustomed to have anything so
remarkable in these regions. The good bishop of these islands, Don Fray
Domingo de Salacar, was bathed with tears of joy when he heard, to the
great refreshing of his spirit, such superior preachers of the gospel
in his bishopric&mdash;men who were not only fit to be teachers of
these heathen races, but to teach others who might be the same, and
this more excellently than he had ever expected to see in those
regions. Among the many various heathen nations who come to this
country that which excels in intelligence, civilization, and courtesy
is that of the Chinese; and, much as they excel in these qualities,
they likewise excel in their multitude and number. For there are very
many who come every year to attend to their <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb216" href="#pb216" name=
"pb216">216</a>]</span>large and rich business, and to serve the city
in all the trades which can be expected in the best regulated of
cities; for they learn everything with the greatest ability, and
succeed in everything that they undertake.</p>
<p>Some of the Chinese, though very few, were Christians; and it was
believed that many would be converted if there were someone to preach
in their language. But this is so difficult that, although many
desirous to undertake that conversion had endeavored to learn it, no
one as yet had succeeded; and thus no religious order had taken up this
ministry, being afraid of the difficulty of the language. When father
Fray Miguel arrived, he instantly undertook this enterprise&mdash;for
the Lord had created him for great things; and this ministry was given
to our order, the bishop asking each and everyone of the religious
orders who were there before to undertake it, and not one of them
accepting it because of the reason given. Father Fray Miguel
immediately began with all his energy to study this language, and
succeeded with it. What is more, he learned many of the letters of it,
which are much more difficult. Father Fray Juan Cobo joining him
immediately, they began to teach the Chinese, amazing those people that
anyone should have been able to succeed with their language and to
preach to them in it. Much greater was their amazement, however, at the
extraordinary virtue and charity which they beheld in these two
religious. They did not content themselves with the labor of teaching
them&mdash;which was not small, for soon many were converted and began
to be baptized; but they proposed to build a hospital where the sick
poor could be cared for. The number of these was great, because their
sufferings <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb217" href="#pb217" name=
"pb217">217</a>]</span>were great in this foreign land, where they were
neglected by all, and suffered the extremity of need, which is sickness
and death. The fathers began their hospitals; and, poor religious as
they were, they had no better house than that which they were able to
make, almost without money, out of beams and old planks&mdash;the
habits and cloaks of the religious often serving as beds, because they
had no other bedclothes. The religious sometimes brought in the sick
whom they found lying on the streets, without power to move themselves
and with no one to pity them. In this way the fame of the virtue of
father Fray Miguel and his companions was very widely spread, and there
were many of the Chinese heathen who were converted and baptized. The
fragrance of this great charity spread so far that it reached Great
China and proclaimed in trumpet tones what was done for their sick in
the Philippinas. There was one man who came from China to look upon so
rare a thing as caring for the sick&mdash;poor, and cast out by their
own nation and kinsmen; but admitted, sought for, and cared for by
persons who were not known to them, and who were not only of another
nation, but of a different law and faith, and who labored without any
expectation of temporal profit, but merely for the salvation of souls.
Hence the Lord was favorable to them, and this work was constantly
growing better in all things. It is today one of the most glorious
things in Christendom, not because of its income and its building
(though in these respects it is very good), but because of the many who
at the hour of death are baptized in it with many indications of going
hence to glory, as being newly cleansed of their faults and their sins
by baptism.</p>
<p>The rich harvest which was reaped in the conversion <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb218" href="#pb218" name="pb218">218</a>]</span>of
these Chinese, as well by preaching to those in health as by the care
and instruction of the sick, was so sweet to father Fray Miguel that it
caused in him glowing desires to go to Great China. It seemed to him,
and with reason, that there, without abandoning their own country and
the company of their fathers, sons, wives, and kinsmen, which here are
great impediments to their conversion, the Christians converted would
be many more, and far better ones. Hence he was always making plans to
go to that great realm, where the devil is so strongly fortified that
he does not even permit the entrance of those who might, by preaching
the gospel, cast him from the throne which he unjustly holds among that
people. He was finally successful in making his entry into that
kingdom, and went there with father Fray Juan de Castro, who was the
first provincial of this province. They suffered the hardships which
have been described in chapter twenty-six, together with the marvelous
miracles which the divine pity wrought in their favor for the preachers
of the gospel. When they returned to Manila from China, where they had
suffered so much, the orders of their superior directed them to
undertake another longer and more painful voyage, which was to
Espa&ntilde;a. They were to accompany and assist the bishop, Don Fray
Domingo de Sala&ccedil;ar, who was going to discuss very important
business with his Majesty; and were also to endeavor to bring back
religious from Espa&ntilde;a, to aid in the great labor which rested
upon the religious of this province in the conversion of the heathen of
these lands, He did not take for this journey money or anything else,
or even more clothes than those which he wore, so that he did not have
a <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb219" href="#pb219" name=
"pb219">219</a>]</span>change of clothes in the whole voyage, which
lasts for six months. A ship is so much an enemy to cleanliness that,
when he reached Mexico, his habit was in such a condition that the
father prior of the convent in that city was obliged to give him
clothes wholly out of charity. During the voyage he fell into the sea
and was miraculously brought back to the ship by the Lord at the prayer
of the good bishop&mdash;who afflicted by the accident, prayed the Lord
briefly but devotedly for the remedy of it; and he gained what he
desired, for the Lord is very quick to listen to the prayers of His
servants. The time between the end of this voyage and that which
follows afterward over the Mar del Norte [<i>i.e.</i>, Atlantic Ocean]
was spent by father Fray Miguel in the convent which offered him
hospitality, but without the dispensations which the reception of
hospitality usually brings with it. He was the first in the choir and
the refectory, and in all the other labor of the convent. In particular
he helped in the infirmary, in caring for the sick and serving them,
whenever he had an opportunity. This was a charge which he took upon
himself when, at the coming of the first founders to the Philippinas,
they were guests in this same convent. As at that time he had done well
in this service, daily exercising many acts of humility and charity,
virtues which are supremely pleasing to God, he would not cease this
same conduct on this second occasion; on the contrary, as one that had
grown in virtue, he did it better than before. What he did here for the
sick religious was not a heavy task [for him], for he had become
accustomed to do much more in his hospital at Manila for the Chinese
heathen, who are by nature filthy <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb220"
href="#pb220" name="pb220">220</a>]</span>and disgusting. Father Fray
Miguel reached Espa&ntilde;a, and was present before the royal Council
of the Indias, endeavoring to obtain religious for this province as its
procurator-general. One of the <span class="corr" id="xd21e1315" title=
"Source: councilors">counselors</span>, incorrectly informed by persons
who resented the sermons of our religious, said: &ldquo;If the matter
were in my hands, the Dominican religious would not be in the
Philippinas.&rdquo; The rest desired him to restrain himself, and he
went on with what he had to say. Father Fray Miguel answered, showing
his cloak, which was very old and patched and full of holes: &ldquo;So
far as concerns ourselves, we have no need to go to the Indias; what we
endeavor to do by going there, this cloak tells well enough.&rdquo; So
well did the cloak of rough, mended serge speak that all were highly
edified, and he who had offered opposition was abashed and corrected.
In the convent of San Estevan he gave to be washed his inner tunic,
which served him in place of a shirt. This was of serge so rough and
hard that one of the religious of the convent of novices, who put it on
over his habit, was unable to bend any more than if it was a bell; and
they all gathered around to look at it as if it were a bell that was
sounded. That which began as jest and ridicule so powerfully supplied
the place of father Fray Miguel in winning religious, that many
determined to go to the province where the religious treated themselves
so rigorously and observed such poverty.</p>
<p>Father Fray Miguel found an evil doctrine spread abroad in the
court, which a member of a religious order<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e1320src" href="#xd21e1320" name="xd21e1320src">45</a> had taken
pains to introduce. He had come <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb221"
href="#pb221" name="pb221">221</a>]</span>from the Philippinas with
documentary authorizations from the bishop and the two cabildos
[<i>i.e.</i>, ecclesiastical and civil], before the province of the
Holy Rosary was established there, and before there were any Dominican
friars in the islands. After having carried on some negotiations at
Roma he had returned to the court, and endeavored to bring it about
that the preaching of the holy gospel in heathen countries should be
begun by soldiers, who by force of weapons and musketry should make the
country quiet and subject the Indians, in order that the preachers
might do their office immediately without resistance. This doctrine is
very well suited to human prudence but is contrary to divine
Providence, to that which the Lord has ordained in His gospel, and even
to the very nature of the faith, which demands a pious affection in
those who hear it. This is not to be acquired as the result of the
violences, murders, and conquests wrought by soldiers. On the contrary,
as far as in them lies, they make the faith to be hated and abhorred;
and hence the Lord commanded that the preachers should be as sheep
among wolves, conquering them with patience and humility, which are the
proper arms to overcome hearts. Hence not only the apostles, but all
the other apostolic preachers who had followed them, have by these
means converted all the nations of the earth. This father saw all this
very well; but it seemed to him, as indeed he said, that these were
old-fashioned arguments and that the world was now very much changed;
and that no conversion of importance could or would be made unless
soldiers went before to bring into subjection those who were to listen
to the gospel, before the preachers preached it. He painted out this
monster with such fair colors <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb222"
href="#pb222" name="pb222">222</a>]</span>of rhetoric and with
arguments so well suited to our weakness, our little spirit, and our
less readiness to suffer for Christ and His gospel, that these lords of
the Council were firmly established in this his doctrine&mdash;a new
doctrine, as its author himself affirmed, and, as such, contrary to the
gospel and to the works of the saints who acted in conformity
therewith. To overcome this error, much was done by the bishop of the
Philippinas and by father Fray Miguel. The latter, being younger, was
able to exert himself more; and being so great a theologian and so
subtile of mind, he was able to adduce such superior arguments, and so
clearly to reveal the poison which was hidden in the arguments of this
religious, that the king our lord and his Council were firmly persuaded
of the truth. They came to regard it as a great inconsistency to say
that our Lord Jesus Christ had acted with so short a view as a
legislator that, when He made a law which was to last to the end of the
world, He had announced a method which was to be followed only at the
beginning by the preachers of it who were present before Him, and not
under the same conditions by those who should follow after&mdash;just
as if His providence were unable to apprehend that which was distant
and future. It will further be seen, if we consider it well, that the
gospel received much more opposition at the beginning than it does at
the present time; and if it was not necessary at that time to subject
kingdoms by war, in order to preach the gospel to them, much less will
it be so now. Hence grave scandal would arise in the church if, when
the Lord commands that gentle sheep shall be the ones to introduce His
gospel, the introduction of it should be entrusted now to bloodthirsty
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb223" href="#pb223" name=
"pb223">223</a>]</span>wolves. Afterward, by the activity and diligence
of father Fray Miguel these black clouds which promised thunderstorms
of arquebuses and soldiery were dissipated; and there were left for the
promulgation of the gospel the gentle clouds of the preachers, which
with the soft rain of teaching, example, and patience have carried the
gospel to the most savage and hardened heathen. On this occasion father
Fray Miguel displayed such force, and such were his arguments, that the
Catholic king directed a most important council to be held, at which
were present the president of Castilla, the father-confessors of the
princes, the auditors of the Audiencia, the lords of the Indias, and
many distinguished theologians. In this conference it was determined
that there should be soldiers in the Spanish towns for the defense of
the country, but that these soldiers should not go as escorts to the
preachers, and that they should not go in advance of them subjugating
or killing Indians; for this would be changing into a gospel of war
that gospel which Christ our Lord delivered to us&mdash;a gospel of
peace, love, and grace. So great was the reputation for learning and
sanctity which father Fray Miguel gained in these matters that, in the
arduous and difficult undertakings which afterward came up, his Majesty
directed that he should be consulted and his judgment should be
followed, as that of a learned man despising all things which were not
of God, and zealous for the good of souls. There was issued at this
time a brief of his Holiness to the effect that the bishops of the
Indias should have authority to make visitations to the religious who
ministered to the Indians, in all matters connected with this ministry,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb224" href="#pb224" name=
"pb224">224</a>]</span>as if they were parish priests. Father Fray
Miguel, understanding the bad results which would follow such a plan,
presented a very learned memorial, signed by all the procurators of the
Indias, to the prince-cardinal Alberto, who gave audience and decided
causes for his Majesty. Nothing more was necessary to cause the brief
to be recalled, and not to be put into execution. Father Fray Miguel
was directed to give the Council of the Indias his advice with regard
to the repartimientos of Indians for mines, estates, and the like. He
gave it, and it was so sound that they esteemed it highly, the more on
account of the character of him who offered it. Hence, when the time
came to appoint bishops for these islands he was appointed the first
bishop of Nueva Segovia, although such an idea had never crossed his
mind, and it was necessary to force him to accept the bishopric. The
Council even went so far as to ask him to indicate to them those who
seemed to him suitable for the other bishoprics; and those whom he thus
indicated were appointed. He sent out religious to the province three
times. The first company he sent with father Fray Alonso Delgado, the
second with father Fray Pedro Ledesma, and the third, whom he
accompanied himself, went under the direction of father Fray Francisco
de Morales as vicar, who was afterwards the first minister of our
religions order in Japon, and a holy martyr. That he might better
prepare the religious for the journey, he went twice from Madrid to
Sevilla when he was already a bishop traveling on foot with his staff
and his hat like a poor friar; so the people who came to find him and
did not know him asked him if he had seen the bishop of Nueva
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb225" href="#pb225" name=
"pb225">225</a>]</span>Segovia. He, to avoid vanity, answered them that
the bishop was on his way to Sevilla, concealing the fact that it was
himself. For the advantage of the inhabitants of Manila, he brought it
about that commerce with Nueva Espa&ntilde;a was opened to them and
that the money which came from their trading was sent back to Manila up
to the amount of five hundred thousand pesos in money or silver
bullion. Up to that time, they had license only to receive the
principal back again; while the profits were retained in Mexico, or
were brought back without a license, at great expense. For the Indians
he obtained, by a memorial which he offered, that the natural dominion
and chieftaincy which they had over their villages should be left to
them, with all their lands, mountains and rivers, and the other rights
which they had from of old; since the fact that they had become
subjects of his Majesty ought not to cause them to lose the natural
right which they had inherited from their ancestors. Further, since the
conquest of these Philipinas Islands had not been carried out
conformably to the holy instructions which the conquerors carried with
them, and which they were bound to observe, but had been carried out in
exactly the opposite manner and with the most serious acts of
injustice, he gave information with regard to these things to his
Majesty and to his royal Council of the Indias. It was decreed that the
consent and voluntary obedience and allegiance of all the Indians
should be asked for anew. The new bishop, Don Fray Miguel, very
earnestly undertook to attempt to carry this decree to execution, and
accordingly it was made. When the bishop was desirous of embarking,
there were so many rumors <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb226" href=
"#pb226" name="pb226">226</a>]</span>of enemies, and the damage
inflicted at Cadiz was so great, that it was impossible to have any
fleet that year; and there was no other vessel for him to travel in
except a small patache with a single deck. The cabin in the poop which
he occupied was so low that it could not be entered exception on
one&rsquo;s knees, while for the twenty religious whom he was taking
there was no accommodation at all. He tried, by putting up an awning,
to protect them from the sun and the water; but the only one on the
ship was full of patches, and very small. The Lord made matters better
for them by causing the voyage which they were obliged to take to be
very calm, for the patache was not built to encounter storms. It did
not rain more than twice, so that they were at least able to lie on the
deck at night, though by day they were compelled to suffer the heat of
the sun, which was extreme and very oppressive in their little patache.
For this the religious gave thanks to the Lord; but the bishop was so
accustomed to hardships that this fair weather grieved him; and he said
that the Lord had forgotten them because He did not send them
hardships, which are the best things which in this life He gives to His
friends. &ldquo;For my sins,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;the Lord deprives
us of hardships, and of the merit which they bring with them when they
are borne with patience for the love of the Lord who sent them. Not so
did we sail on our first journey when so devoted servants of God were
going; but we traveled in great and continual
afflictions&mdash;tempests, fire, and fears of enemies. That we should
now lack all this, and travel with such fair weather when we are not
such as they, is not for our good. In me is the fault; it is well that
I should feel it and weep over it.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb227" href="#pb227" name="pb227">227</a>]</span>When he went ashore,
he traveled on foot all the way to Mexico, and from there to the port
of Acapulco, a distance of more than a hundred and fifty leguas. Thus
he afforded the example of a poor religious, even when his state as a
bishop would have excused him from such poverty and hardship. However,
he did not seek for excuses, but for opportunities for poverty and
religious devotion, though at the expense of so great an exertion, and
in his advanced age. He reached Manila at a time when there happened to
be a procession from our convent to the cathedral, because of an
occasional need. He disembarked there, at a gate which was near our
convent on the shore, and the procession began by receiving him. This
caused much joy, on account of the high esteem and regard in which he
was held by both religious and laymen. He accompanied the procession to
the cathedral, and when the time came he went into the pulpit, taking
the sermon from him to whom it had been committed. He preached most
eloquently; and, though he came down bathed in perspiration, he did not
change the heavy tunic of sackcloth which he wore. On the contrary, he
went direct to the sacristy and robed himself to say mass, though he
said it very slowly, and with so much feeling that it was a great
effort for him. These were acts, and this was an entry, which promised
an extremely good bishop and superior. The promise was not falsified,
but fell short of the truth, so much did he surpass it. He went
straight to his poor bishopric to care for his flock. In the principal
part of his diocese, the province of Nueva Segovia, they were nearly
all heathen. There were only about two hundred baptized adults, those
who were not so being <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb228" href=
"#pb228" name="pb228">228</a>]</span>innumerable; for it was only a
very short time since our religious had begun to preach the gospel to
them. When the new bishop was once among his sheep, he began to watch
over their welfare, and to defend them from the alcaldes-mayor and the
encomenderos, who abused them like wolves. The bishop&rsquo;s conduct
forced him to hear rough words and violent insults from those who had
fattened themselves with the blood of the Indians. They feared lest
they should grow lean if the shepherd, coming out to the defense of the
flock, were to force them to be satisfied with moderate returns,
without flaying the sheep. The bishop was not intimidated, and did not
desist from this just and due defense; nor did he cease to strive for
the good of his Indians against the outrages which he beheld. On the
contrary, he strove to give his remonstrances their due effect and if
he was unable to succeed there in securing the rights of the Indians,
he was accustomed to write to the governor and the Audiencia, without
taking his hand from the work until he had brought it to the perfection
which he desired. Though he aided the Indians, he did not neglect the
Spaniards, who lived in the principal towns of his bishopric less
edifying and exemplary lives than those whose Christianity is ancient
ought to lead in towns of the newly converted. They are under
obligation to be shining lights, to give light to those who are either
blind because of their heathen belief, or who know little of God
because they have been newly baptized. He stirred them up to live as
they ought, and aided them in their necessities like a loving father;
if he could not make them such as he wished, he improved them as much
as possible. At the death of the archbishop of Manila, he was
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb229" href="#pb229" name=
"pb229">229</a>]</span>obliged to go to that city, and saw in it so
many things contrary to the divine Majesty and to the human one that he
found himself under the necessity of writing to his Majesty a letter
very full of feeling, which begins: &ldquo;I have twice visited this
city of Manila since I came to these islands as bishop. The first time
was last year, ninety-nine, because I received reliable information
that the governor and the auditors were in such bitter opposition that
there was fear of a serious rupture. Now, learning that there was no
archbishop in the city, it seemed desirable&rdquo; (and was so without
doubt) &ldquo;that I should be present and prepared for any
contingency.&rdquo; He gives an account of what had happened, and says:
&ldquo;I am obliged to speak as my position and the condition of
affairs require, very clearly, without caring who may be affected by my
words; for God, your Majesty, and the common weal are of more
importance than any smaller things.&rdquo; The truth of what he stated,
and the clearness with which he spoke, are plain in the rest of the
letter, which to avoid prolixity is not inserted here. He strove to
settle the state of the church in these islands; and when he saw some
bad customs introduced without any foundation, and contrary to reason
and theology, he was greatly grieved. What he was not himself able to
remedy, he wrote of to the supreme pontiff. Since the competency of the
bishop was so well known in Espa&ntilde;a, he was appointed archbishop
as soon as the vacancy was known, although he had no procurator there;
for, being a poor and peaceful bishop, he did not expect to carry on
any suits, and hence did not care for a procurator or agent at court.
Since his poverty was known, his Majesty caused the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb230" href="#pb230" name=
"pb230">230</a>]</span>bulls to be drawn, and directed the royal
officials of Manila to collect from the bishop the expense of drawing
them when it should be convenient for him to pay it. The bishop
hesitated long, and asked the advice of many, before he accepted this
promotion, having seen and experienced the difficulties, the
opposition, and the dissensions which accompanied this dignity, at such
a distance from the eyes of his Majesty and of the supreme pontiff, to
whom in difficult cases (of which there were many) he might have had
recourse. Yet finally, since all thought that it was desirable for him
to accept the office, he was compelled to take it for the public good,
although he saw that for his private advantage it would be very
injurious. Becoming an archbishop did not change that poor and humble
manner of living which he had followed as bishop and as religious. He
continued to wear the same habit of serge and tunics of wool. His food
was always fish, unless he had a guest, which happened seldom; or
unless he was afflicted by some infirmity. Whenever he had a journey to
take on land&mdash;for traveling in these islands is usually carried on
by water&mdash;he was accustomed to go on foot; and, that he might
travel with more abstraction from the world, he used to walk uttering
prayers. He sent the others forward in hammocks or on horseback and he
followed after alone, commending to the Lord himself and the
undertakings in which he was engaged, in order that they might turn out
more satisfactorily. If, when he was indisposed, he was forced by
pleadings to go into a hammock&mdash;something which is much used in
this country, and which is carried by Indians&mdash;he used to get out
again as soon as he left the town, and <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb231" href="#pb231" name="pb231">231</a>]</span>sometimes earlier, if
he heard any of the carriers groan; for this groan so penetrated his
soul that it was not possible for him to travel any farther in this
manner. His bed was the same which he had when a poor friar, a mat of
rushes or palm-branches on a plank. The small income of his
archbishopric he spent in alms; and he used to delight in giving them
with his own hands, kissing the alms with great devotion as if he were
giving them to Christ, who has said that He receives them when they are
given in His name to the poor. That the principal door of his house
might not cause embarrassments to persons who had known better days and
who were under the necessity of asking alms, he had another door for
these persons which was always open, so that they might come at any
time to tell him their troubles, and that he might relieve them as well
as possible. In this way he spent all his income, and therefore had
very little expense or ostentation in his household. He never had a
mule or a chair to go about with, avoiding all this that he might have
means to give to the poor. He was most devoted to the ministry and
instruction of the Indians and the Chinese; and, whenever he had an
opportunity for doing so, he used to aid in it with great pleasure. He
envied much those who were occupied in so meritorious an exercise, as
he wrote in the last year of his life to those whom he had left behind
in Nueva Segovia, in a letter which reads as follows: &ldquo;To my
fathers and brethren, the religious of the Order of St. Dominic in
Nueva Segovia. A poor brother of your Reverences, very weak in health
and very full of troubles and of his own wretchedness, has written this
to your Reverences, his truest brethren, who are walking <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb232" href="#pb232" name=
"pb232">232</a>]</span>about in those places of rest and new fields of
the true paradise, feeding the flocks of the Great Shepherd and
rejoicing your souls with the sports and the gambols which the new-born
lambs are making upon the hill-sides at the dawn of the true sun. May
your Reverences refresh yourselves and feed upon that celestial milk
which creates manna covered with honey upon those mountains. May you
rejoice in the fair season that now is; for I once tasted the same
pleasures&mdash;though the fair weather lasted but for a short time for
me, because of my sins and my pride; and now I see myself wretched as
no one else is wretched. Happy the father provincial, who, having seen
as from the parapet of a bull-ring something of the wounds and the
bulls here, has returned so soon to the delights of that region, and is
among his sheep. I refer you to him; let him speak the love which I
have for every one of your Reverences and the esteem which I feel for
you all. Pay me with the money of love and pity. <i lang="es">Valete in
Domino, viscera mea, felices valete in aeternum.</i><a class="noteref"
id="xd21e1357src" href="#xd21e1357" name="xd21e1357src">46</a> To all
the Indians, a thousand greetings; and I beg their prayers for this
poor soul.&rdquo; His life was continually burdened with scruples which
sometimes are more cruel enemies than those who are openly declared as
such. They were not born in him from ignorance, but from his great
depreciation of himself and from his looking upon the greatness of God,
both of which caused him to be always timid. This, as he said, was the
counterweight with which the Lord burdened him that he might not be
puffed up by the great blessings which the Lord had granted him.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb233" href="#pb233" name=
"pb233">233</a>]</span>He preached continually, that he might the
better advise and direct his sheep. He grieved for the poor much; and
over sinners he was a Jeremiah, weeping for what they failed to lament,
that he might make them weep. He was deeply versed in sacred scripture,
and with it he filled his writings, and even the ordinary letters which
he wrote. In the opinions which he gave, everything was founded upon
and approved by the divine authority, which was his rule and his arms,
both offensive and defensive. He was accustomed to read with great care
the sacred councils and canons of the church. In them he found stated
with the greatest precision everything of which he had need for the
government of his church, as well as for the satisfactory decision of
the questions with regard to which they asked his opinion, and of the
disputes which arose among learned persons. When there were different
opinions among such persons, he was accustomed to say, &ldquo;<i lang=
"la">Veritas liberabit nos</i> [<i>i.e.</i>, &ldquo;the truth shall
make us free&rdquo;], and this will make clear to us that for which we
seek; let us follow it and strive for it.&rdquo; This confidence was
always justified; for on many occasions when it seemed that the whole
world was in a tumult, and that justice was certain to be clouded over
and obscured, he was then accustomed to say, with the greatest
confidence, &ldquo;The truth shall make us free,&rdquo; and finally it
turned out so. Because of the love which he had for truth, he could not
endure to hear new opinions; and if they were opposed to the doctrine
of the ancient saints, he attacked them like a lion set on fire, though
he was in all other things as gentle as a lamb. For the same cause, he
was most devoted to the teaching of St. Thomas&mdash;<span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb234" href="#pb234" name="pb234">234</a>]</span>who,
like a mystic bee, made the honeycomb of his works from the flowers of
holy scripture, sacred councils, sacred canons, and the works of the
saints whom the Lord gave to His church as teachers and guides for its
direction. In order that in the Philippinas so sound and safe a
doctrine should be read, he strove greatly that in the province,
although the numbers were so few, there should always be some one to
read St. Thomas. As soon as he entered upon his archbishopric, he asked
for a religious of our order to read in the cathedral to those who had
been ordained; and carefully took pains to encourage and favor those
who went to listen, so that the rest should imitate them. This desire
he retained up to his death; and hence in his last sickness he gave the
little which he had, asking the order to build a college for this
purpose. With this beginning, which was of the value of a thousand
pesos, was established the college which we now have in Manila under
the advocacy of St. Thomas, in order that from their first letters the
students may feel an affection to this holy doctrine, and may follow
him afterward when they are further advanced. The devotion which Don
Fray Miguel felt for our Lady was so great that in everything which he
did or said he commended it to her, saying an <i>Ave Maria</i> before
he began. So scrupulous was he that he was unable to say the <i>Ave
Maria</i> unless he understood all the circumstances; and even if it
occupied a considerable time for him to repeat it, still, in spite of
this, he always said it. One day the dean of his church, Don Francisco
de Arellano&mdash;a man whom, on account of his virtue, the bishop
loved and esteemed&mdash;asked what was the beginning of this devotion,
and whence <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb235" href="#pb235" name=
"pb235">235</a>]</span>it was derived. He answered that our Lady
herself, to whom at first he had said the <i>Ave Maria</i>, was the
beginning, and that she it was who had taught him this devotion. The
dean remained in wonder, and did not dare to ask him more on this
point; nor did the good archbishop ever make any further declaration.
Hence the mode in which this happened was never known; but the great
attention which he gave to it was seen. Whenever there was anything to
be done the <i>Ave Maria</i> always preceded. It was said before he
answered or put a question, or took any medicine, or gave alms, or did
anything else. Thus always all his acts were actually referred to God
our Lord, and to His most holy Mother. This was a custom of the highest
virtue; but when the business was of unusual weight, he was not
contented with an <i>Ave Maria</i>, but recited a rosary. Thus he did
in China, when the judges caused him to write a petition in their
presence in Chinese characters&mdash;something which far exceeded his
powers, but not those of the Virgin. Accordingly he wrote a miraculous
petition, to the satisfaction of the judges. They believed that which
they saw to be impossible, as it really was; for though father Fray
Miguel knew some of the commoner Chinese letters, he did not understand
those which were necessary for what was then required of him, since
they were extremely peculiar and were in the judicial style, with which
he was not acquainted. Hence this was doubtless a miraculous event,
worthy of the compassion with which this great Lady comes to the aid of
her afflicted devotees. The sufferings of the archbishop from storms at
sea, as well as from the opposition of clergymen and laymen with
disrespectful words <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb236" href="#pb236"
name="pb236">236</a>]</span>and acts, were very great, but were the
cause of great happiness. As was affirmed by his confessor&mdash;a
religious of great virtue, a man who had known him for many years and
who was familiar with the secrets of his soul&mdash;when the sufferings
were at their greatest, and in his sorrow and affliction he went to
God, our Lord himself visibly consoled him and gave him strength, not
once, but often. To this was attributed his habit of looking sometimes
with his eyes fixed on heaven, with flames of fire, as it were, shining
upon his face. On such occasions he was heard to utter some words
which, without his striving or having power to say more, he spoke in
affectionate converse with God. This caused great devotion in those who
heard; and as it was so, it is no wonder that he so much desired other
sufferings in addition to the weighty cross of his scruples, because
their absence was much more painful to him than the necessity of
enduring them. Hence he showed much more sadness and melancholy when he
was exposed to no hardships than when they were heaped upon him; for in
the latter case he was sure of the consolation of heaven, which was
lacking when he had no sufferings.</p>
<p>The end of his days finally approached; and as he lay on his bed it
was plain to him that this was his last sickness, and he began to
prepare for this important journey. At his departure he was much
afflicted to leave without a minister the Indians of Marivelez, which
is situated at no great distance from Manila. Since these Indians were
few and by themselves, he had found no one who was willing to accept
the charge of them. Taking advantage of the present occasion, he sent
for father Fray Miguel <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb237" href=
"#pb237" name="pb237">237</a>]</span>de San Jacintho, who at that time
was provincial of the province, and most energetically begged him to
urge on his religious to give instruction to these poor Indians. When
the provincial promised that he would do all he could for this purpose,
the bishop remained in great content, as if there were nothing now to
cause him sorrow. He divided his poor treasures, sending part of them
immediately to his church, and giving part to our Lady of the Rosary,
and part to the poor. In his illness he did not complain or ask for
anything; and when he was asked if he wished or longed for anything, he
answered, &ldquo;I desire to be saved.&rdquo; His face was very full of
joy, and the words which he uttered came forth kindled so by the love
of God that they showed plainly what a fire of love was in the breast
where they were forged. He asked them to dress him in his habit; and on
the coming of the festival of the glorious St. Anne in the year 1605 he
asked them to get ready his pontifical robes, as if he were preparing
to go out on that festal day. This was as much as to say that his
departure was at hand. He was surrounded by his friars, and though they
saw him joyful they themselves were very sad to perceive that they were
to be deprived of such a superior and such a religious. He consoled
them with loving words, and, perceiving that his departure was at hand
he called fervently upon his special patroness, the Virgin, his
guardian angel, our father St. Dominic, and the other saints of his
devotion, with whom he spoke as if he were already with them in heaven.
His countenance appeared to be celestial rather than to belong to
earth; and amid loving converse with God, with His most holy Mother,
and with the saints, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb238" href="#pb238"
name="pb238">238</a>]</span>his soul departed to his Lord, leaving his
body, as many said, fragrant with the odor of roses. By the voice of
all, he was given the palm of a virgin, as if all had heard him in
confession and felt the certainty which his confessor had and
manifested in this respect, although this declaration was made after
that in which the palm had been given to him as to a virgin. When the
fathers of St. Francis came, father Fray Vicente Valero, who lived and
died with the reputation of sainthood, went up to the dead man, saying,
&ldquo;This body is holy and should be regarded as such,&rdquo; and
kissed the feet. After this all of his religious did the same thing,
and they were followed by the others, for in this way the Lord honors
those who faithfully serve Him. His interment was performed with all
possible solemnity in the cathedral, on the epistle side near the high
altar. The archbishop left behind him some writings of much erudition,
and full of Christian teaching, which are very helpful to the ministers
of the holy gospel.</p>

<h3 class="label">Chapter LXII</h3>
<h3 class="main">Of some religious who died at this time</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">[At this time there were taken away by death a number
of the most superior religious, the lack of whom was greatly felt. In
the year of our Lord 1604 one of the definitors in the provincial
chapter was father Fray Pedro de San Vicente. He was elected as a
definitor in the general chapter, and also as procurator of the
province at the courts of Espa&ntilde;a and Roma. There was no one at
either court at that time, and a procurator was necessary, especially
for the purpose of bringing over religious from Espa&ntilde;a,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb239" href="#pb239" name=
"pb239">239</a>]</span>without whom this province could not be
maintained. He set out to undertake the duties entrusted to him, in the
ships which sailed that year for Nueva Espa&ntilde;a, and died on the
way, the same ships in the following year bringing back the news of his
death. Father Fray Pedro was a native of Zalamea. He assumed the habit
in the convent of San Esteban at Salamanca, whence he came to this
province in the year 1594. Here he was engaged in the ministry of
Bataan, and afterward in the ministry to the Chinese of Binondoc, being
much beloved and esteemed in both these offices. He always thought well
of all, and never spoke ill of anyone. He was twice superior of
Binondoc, to the great spiritual and temporal augmentation of that
mission. He set sail on the voyage without taking a real or a piece of
silk, or any other thing, either for the journey or for the business
which fell to his charge, trusting solely in the divine Providence. He
even refused to take for his convent some articles of little value
here, but esteemed as rare and curious in Espa&ntilde;a, and such as it
is customary for a religious to take as a mark of affection to the
convent where he assumed the habit. When he died he made the following
testament or declaration: &ldquo;I, Fray Pedro de San Vicente, declare
that I die as a friar of St. Dominic, without having in my possession
gold or silver, or anything else, except one old blanket with which I
cover myself at night. I pray for the love of God that this may be
given to a boy who travels with me, named Andresillo.&rdquo; Let it be
remembered that father Fray Pedro was in the Philippinas ten years, for
the greater part of the time minister to the Chinese and for four years
their vicar, and that he was very much <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb240" href="#pb240" name="pb240">240</a>]</span>beloved; that they
are of their nature inclined to make presents; that many in this town
are very rich, and are ready to give much on small occasions; and that
when they saw him about to go to Espa&ntilde;a they were much more
likely to show generosity, without his needing to put forward any
effort. Any one who will consider these things, and who will observe
that he went from among them so poor, without money or anything else,
will clearly recognize his great virtue, and see how justly he is
entitled to the great praise of the Holy Spirit, who says, &ldquo;Happy
is he who does not follow after gold, and who does not put his trust in
the treasures of money; who is he? let us praise him because he has
wrought marvels in his life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the province of Nueva Segovia there died at this time father Fray
Jacintho Pardo, a learned theologian and a virtuous religious. He was a
native of Cuellar and took the habit in San Pablo at Valladolid. He was
so much beloved in the convent that the elder fathers strove to retain
him; but it was shown in a vision to a devout woman that father Fray
Jacintho was to serve among the heathen.] He was sent to Nueva Segovia,
where there were very many heathen to be converted; for at that time
missionaries had just been sent there, and nearly the whole of the
province was without them. The natives were fierce, constantly causing
alarm from warlike disturbances, and were much given to idolatry and to
the vices which accompany it. The good fortune of going thither fell to
him; and he immediately learned the ordinary language of that province
so perfectly that he was the first to compose a grammar of it. Since
the village of Tuguegarao (where he lived) in La Yrraya had, although
the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb241" href="#pb241" name=
"pb241">241</a>]</span>inhabitants understood this common and general
language, another particular language of their own, in which it pleased
them better to hear and answer, he undertook the labor of learning that
also, and succeeded very well. He acted thus as one desirous in all
ways of attracting them to Christ, without giving any consideration to
his own labor, and to the fact that this language could be of no use
outside of this village. They were a warlike, ferocious, and wrathful
tribe; and, being enraged against their Spanish encomendero, they
killed him, and threatened the religious that they would take his life
unless he left the village. Being enraged, and having declared war
against the Spaniards, they did not wish to see him among them. But
father Fray Jacintho, who loved them for the sake of God more than for
his own life, desired to bring them to a reconciliation and to peace;
and was unwilling to leave the village, in spite of their threats. To
him indeed they were not threats, but promises of something which he
greatly desired. Under these circumstances he fell sick, and in a few
days ended his life. The Spaniards, knowing what the Indians had said,
believed that they had given him poison so that he should not preach to
them or reconcile them with the Spaniards; and this opinion was shared
by the physician, because of his very speedy death. If this were true,
it was a happy death which he suffered in such a holy cause. He died on
the day of the eleven thousand virgins, to whom he showed a particular
devotion; and it might have been a reward to him to die on such a day,
since the church knows by experience the great protection which these
saints offer at that time to those who are devoted to them.</p>
<p>[In the district of Bataan died Father Juan de la <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb242" href="#pb242" name=
"pb242">242</a>]</span>Cruz, a son of the convent of San Pablo at
Sevilla. He was one of the first founders of this province, in which he
lived for eighteen years. He was small of body, and weak and delicate
in constitution; but his zeal gave him strength for the great labors
which accompanied the beginning of this conversion. He was one of the
first workers in the field of Pangasinan, where he suffered all the
evils and miseries which have been described in the account of that
conversion. He very rapidly learned the language of these Indians,
which they call Tagala; and succeeded so perfectly with it that father
Fray Francisco San Joseph, who was afterwards the best linguist there
was, profited by the papers and labors of father Fray Juan de la Cruz.
Father Fray Juan even learned afterward two other Indian languages,
those of the Zambales and the Pampangos. Father Fray Juan, being the
only linguist among the fathers, was called upon constantly to hear
confessions; and therefore suffered even more than the rest from the
exposures of traveling from place to place in this district. These
hardships broke down the health even of strong men like father Fray
Christobal de Salvatierra, who suffered from a terrible asthma. Father
Fray Juan was afflicted by an asthma so terrible that it seemed as if
every night must be his last; and he felt the dreadful anxiety which
accompanies this disease. He also suffered from two other diseases even
more severe, colic and urinary ailments, which afflicted him even more
than the asthma. He was so patient and so angelic in nature that all
these diseases and afflictions could not disturb him or make him
irritable. His body he treated like a wild beast that had to be tamed,
weakening it with fasts, binding <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb243"
href="#pb243" name="pb243">243</a>]</span>it with chains, mortifying it
with hair-shirts, and chastising it with scourgings. He was chosen as
confessor by the archbishop of Manila, Don Fray Miguel de Venavides.
Immediately after the death of the archbishop he returned to his labors
among the Indians, but did not survive long. When a religious of the
Order of St. Dominic is about to breathe his last, the rest of the
convent gather about him to aid him to die well; and to call them
together some boards are struck or a rattle is sounded, he who strikes
them repeating, &ldquo;Credo, credo.&rdquo; Father Fray Juan de la
Cruz, desiring to follow the usual custom of the order, taught an
Indian to strike together these boards, although the father was alone
in the village; and this was the last farewell of this noble religious.
He had refused repeated requests to return to Manila for care; and he
was buried, as he desired, in the church of those Indians for whose
spiritual good he had spent his life.</p>
<p>In this year 1605 the religious of our order had been three years in
Japon. They were not a little disturbed by a brief which at this time
reached Japon and which had been obtained by the fathers of the Society
of Jesus. This brief directed that all the religious and secular clergy
who desired to preach in Japon might go thither by the way of Eastern
India, but that no one should have authority to go by way of the
Western Indias. The brief directed that all who had come in that way or
by the Philippinas should depart, on penalty of major excommunication,
<i lang="la">lat&aelig; sententi&aelig;</i>. The religious of the other
orders, when this brief was shown to them by the fathers of the
Society, replied that the brief had been presented in the previous year
to the archbishop <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb244" href="#pb244"
name="pb244">244</a>]</span>of Manila; and that the fathers of the
various orders had laid before the archbishop reasons for supposing
that his Holiness had been misinformed, and had appealed to the supreme
pontiff for a reconsideration. They declared that it was unreasonable
to expect them to leave Japon until the reply of the supreme pontiff
should be received. The brief was annulled by his Holiness Paul V in
1608, only three years after the petition; and this repeal was
confirmed afterwards by Urban VIII. In the interim the fathers of the
Society of Jesus did things which annoyed the other religious, but were
not sufficient to drive them from Japon. After the repeal the superior
sent fathers Fray Thomas del Spiritu Sancto, or Zumarraga, and Fray
Alonso de Mena to extend the mission from Satzuma to Vomura
[<i>i.e.</i>, Omura]. It was a time of great disturbance and of much
feeling against the Christians. The fathers of the order did what they
could for some fathers of the Society of Jesus who were imprisoned in a
church. They went on to the kingdom of Firando&mdash;the lord of
which<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1430src" href="#xd21e1430" name=
"xd21e1430src">47</a> had in 1587 begged for religious of St. Francis,
but was now strongly opposed to Christianity. Among his vassals they
found some who were Christians in secret, and encouraged them and gave
them the sacraments of the church.] <span class="pagenum">[<a id=

of the Rosary; the foundation of her religious confraternity in this
province, and the entry of religious into it.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">On April 16, 1606, an intermediate chapter was held in
Manila, at which notice was given of the brief of Pope Clement VIII,
<i lang="la">De largitione munerum</i>. Directions were given to
observe this brief with rigorous exactness, in all things which it
commands to all religious orders and religious. It was ordered and
directed that all memorable things, worthy of being placed in history,
which had happened in this province should be diligently gathered
together. In accordance with this, the father provincial gave a formal
precept to all the religious of the province that they should write
down, each one of them, what he knew in regard to this matter with all
accuracy and truth. In this way something of that which has here been
recounted was brought together; but there continues to be much which
remains buried in oblivion. Some difficulties were resolved; and it was
decreed that devotions to some saints should be offered, whose
devotions had up to that time not been offered in the province.</p>
<p>On the first of April in this year occurred the glorious victory
which Don Pedro de Acu&ntilde;a, knight of the Habit of St. John,
knight-commander of Salamanca, governor and captain-general of these
islands, gained in the Malucas, restoring them to the crown of
Espa&ntilde;a, as for many years had been desired and intended but
without effect. This memorable victory was won by the intercession of
our Lady of the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb246" href="#pb246"
name="pb246">246</a>]</span>Rosary, who was the sole source of it. This
important stronghold remains incorporated in the government and
province of the Philippinas, to the immortal reputation and glory of
the great soldier and devout cavalier who gained them during his
government. He deserves this glory not less for his devout Christian
zeal, love of God, and devotion to our Lady of the Rosary&mdash;in
which from his tenderest years he was bred by his most devout and
prudent mother&mdash;than for his great military skill and prudence,
which he and all his valorous brothers acquired from his father, a
distinguished and most fortunate captain, as also he saw all his sons
become. The great favor which our Lady of the Rosary showed to our army
in this conquest was very well known and celebrated. That the evidence
of it might be more clearly made known to those who were not present
[at the victory], a formal narrative of the matter was made before the
treasurer Don Luis de Herrera Sandoval, vicar-general of this
archiepiscopate in the year 1609. Many witnesses being examined, all
agreed that this fort was gained by the miraculous aid of the Virgin,
though the soldiers did not on that account fight the less valiantly.
It was plain, in many things that happened, that sovereign assistance
was given by this Lady, as may be seen by referring to the statement of
the first witness, the sargento-mayor of that army, Christobal de
Azcueta Menchaca, who was present throughout the whole matter; and, who
on account of his position, had better knowledge of what occurred than
anyone else in the army. His statement is as follows: &ldquo;In the
month of February, 1606, the governor was at Oton, four leguas from the
town of Arebalo, in the bishopric <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb247"
href="#pb247" name="pb247">247</a>]</span>of Zebu, on his way to the
conquest of Maluco&mdash;where the Dutch had built a fort, and had made
treaties of peace with the king of that country against the Castilians
and Portuguese. It was also said that they had invaded the country of
the king of Tidore, our ally. The governor mustered his forces at Oton;
and with those who had come from Mexico in June, and those who had been
added in these islands, the total number was thirteen hundred Spanish
infantry, and six hundred Indians from the vicinity of Manila, who
fought courageously under the protection of the Spaniards. Religious of
all orders accompanied the troops, and among them was a certain father
Fray Andres of the Order of St. Dominic, with another lay religious. As
if by legitimate inheritance from their father, all the friars of this
habit had in their charge the devotion to the Holy Rosary; and hence
father Fray Andres suggested to the sargento-mayor that her holy
confraternity should be established in this army, that this our Lady
might open the door to the difficult entrance they were to make. The
sargento-mayor spoke to the governor in regard to the matter, and to
the holy bishop of Zebu, Don Fray Pedro de Agurto. The sargento-mayor
received permission to discuss it in the army, and the captains and
soldiers all agreed with great heartiness; and they determined that the
holy confraternity should be immediately established, with all its
ceremonies and ordinances, so that this important enterprise might
begin with some service done to our Lady the Virgin. The governor
ordered the image of our Lady of the Rosary to be embroidered on the
royal standard, that she might guide the army. He was the first to
pledge himself as a member of the confraternity, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb248" href="#pb248" name="pb248">248</a>]</span>and
was followed by the master-of-camp, Juan de Esquivel, and the captains,
the soldiers and sailors, and the members of his household&mdash;all of
them promising alms when they should be provided with money on account
of their pay. It was then proposed to establish the confraternity in
the first city which should be gained from the enemy, and to call it
&ldquo;the City of the Rosary.&rdquo; For this purpose a canvas was
painted, having upon it a representation of our Lady with her son Jesus
in her arms, distributing rosaries to the governor, the master-of-camp,
the captains, and the rest of the soldiers. They confessed and received
communion, and went in procession, as is customary when the
confraternity is established. The bishop celebrated pontifical mass,
giving dignity to this solemn act with his holy presence. According to
the ordinances, a Dominican friar is obliged to preach if any be
present. Since Fray Andres had little skill in this office, and spoke
with little grace, he tried to arrange that the bishop should preach;
but matters turned out so that the religious was obliged to preach the
great things of the Mother of God and of her rosary. As all this had
been guided by God, and the preacher chosen by His own will, God
controlled the preacher&rsquo;s tongue in such a manner that all should
be fulfilled which concerned His purpose. Thus the father amazed those
who were present&mdash;the bishop to such an extent that he said aloud
to the whole congregation: &ldquo;Gentlemen this blessed father has
preached in such a manner that it seems the Holy Spirit has been
dictating to him that which he has said; and I do not know what account
to give of the same except to praise God, for it is He who <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb249" href="#pb249" name=
"pb249">249</a>]</span>caused it.&rdquo; The fleet sailed to Tidore;
and when it reached there the forces spent Holy Week in confessing and
receiving communion. While they were there an eclipse of the moon
occurred, which was taken by the augurs of the island as a bad omen,
and they uttered presages of evil, and cried aloud; but the Spaniards
took it as an omen of victory. They did not find in Tidore the king,
who was friendly. They discovered two Dutchmen who had a factory there;
and they and that which was in the factory were held for the king of
Espa&ntilde;a. On Friday of Easter week, which was the last day of
March, the fleet cast anchor a cannon-shot from the fort of Ternate;
and on Saturday the artillery from the ships and galleys was fired, to
clear the field. The sargento-mayor made a landing with the army,
drawing them up along the creek between the fort and the sea. The
vanguard was held by the master-of-camp, Gallinato, lookouts being
posted in the trees. While he was planning to make gabions, the tumult
of the army, as if the voice of all, declared that they should not
doubt the victory; that on that very day they were going to capture the
fort and the country, for it was Saturday, a day dedicated to our Lady.
They began with great readiness. It was about midday, an hour little
suited for an attack in so hot a country, for the sun beat down on
them. In addition, on one side they were harassed by falcon-shots fired
from the fort of Cachitulco; it was a very effective weapon, although
at first they shot their balls too high. After lowering their aim
somewhat, they struck seven Spaniards. The companions of the governor
forced him to move to another place, as balls were constantly striking
where he was. At the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb250" href="#pb250"
name="pb250">250</a>]</span>very moment when he left the spot, his
shield-bearer, stepping into his place, was struck. On this account the
sargento-mayor endeavored to hold back the forces until they could hear
what the lookouts said, or receive an order from the governor. From
among the body of the troops he heard a voice, calling upon him to
attack without doubting of the victory; that the mother of God purposed
that on that day her holy confraternity should be established in this
country. The sargento-mayor turned his head and asked in a loud voice:
&ldquo;What devout or holy person has said this to us?&rdquo; There was
no answer, and it was not known from whom the voice proceeded; but it
seemed to him that it spoke to him from within, and that it came from
heaven. It inspired in him such spirit and courage that he turned to
the captains and said: &ldquo;Gentlemen, the mother of God wills us to
gain this fort today.&rdquo; Captain Cubas reached the fort, from which
his troops were somewhat driven back by the Moros, and his foot was
wounded by a pointed stake [<i>puia</i>]. Some beginning to call
&ldquo;Sanctiago!&rdquo; and others &ldquo;Victory!&rdquo; they all
began to run on boldly and proudly without any order. So quickly was
the fort taken that the captain-general did not even know it when the
soldiers had actually surmounted the wall. They went on to where the
king was fortified, with many arquebuses and culverins; and with four
pieces of ordnance (<i lang="es">pie&ccedil;as de bat&iuml;r</i>), and
with a high wall, from which the enemy did much execution with
bucacaos<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1466src" href="#xd21e1466" name=
"xd21e1466src">48</a> and fire-hardened reeds anointed with poison. But
none of these things availed him; and, seeing that the day was lost he
fled with some of his <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb251" href=
"#pb251" name="pb251">251</a>]</span>followers, in a caracoa and four
xuangas, to the island of the Moro, or Batachina [<i>i.e.</i>, Gilolo],
to which they had sent their women and children and their wealth. On
account of this the sack did not bring very much gold or money, but
amounted to only two thousand ducats and some cloth and cloves. The
rest of the prize was artillery, culverins, arms, and ammunition. After
the victory, the sargento-mayor went to ask the governor for the
countersign, and found him on his knees before an image of our Lady,
saying: &ldquo;I beg humility of you, our Lady, since by you this
victory has been gained.&rdquo; On the following day, Sunday, the
second of April (which was, accordingly, the first Sunday in the
month), the governor ordered an altar to be prepared, and directed that
the painting we carried of the mother of God of the Rosary, with the
governor, the captains and the men at her feet should be placed
thereon, so that mass might be said. They brought from the mosque a
pulpit, in which father Fray Andres preached. That which had previously
been a mosque was from that day forth the parish church and mother
church&mdash;the religious living in one part of it, and administering
the holy sacrament. The confraternity was established, and it and the
city and the principal fort received the name of El Rosario
[<i>i.e.</i>, &ldquo;The Rosary&rdquo;] that this signal mercy might
remain in the memory of those who were to come. In these events there
were many things that appeared miraculous. The first of them was the
voice which the sargento-mayor heard, with regard to which he declared
upon oath that he could not find out who spoke it, that it appeared to
speak to him within, and that the words inspired in him great
confidence, as has <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb252" href="#pb252"
name="pb252">252</a>]</span>been said. The second miraculous element is
the speed with which victory was attained; for when the governor went
away to speak, with the king of Tidore, who is friendly, the report
that the fort had been gained reached him so quickly that the governor
was amazed, and the king did not believe it. The third was the few
deaths which occurred on our side; for only fifteen died in the war,
and twenty were wounded. The fourth is that when a Dutchman&mdash;or,
as others say, a man of Terrenate&mdash;was trying to fire a large
paterero to clear a straight path where a great number of our soldiers
were marching up hill in close order, he tried three times to fire it
with a linstock, but was unable to do so. When the Moros told him to
hasten and fire it, he said that a lady with a blue mantle was
preventing him with a corner of the mantle, and sprinkling sand in the
touch-hole. So, throwing away the linstock, he began to run; and the
Spaniards came up with him and killed him.</p>
<p>At the beginning of August in the same year, large reenforcements of
religious came from Espa&ntilde;a; and so great was the need which
there was of them that they came at a very fortunate time, especially
since they were picked men in virtue and learning. The first who
volunteered for this province were five members of the college of
Sancto Thomas at Alcala, which event attracted so much attention in the
convent of San Estevan at Salamanca that, when the vicar of the
religious reached there, thirteen members of that convent volunteered.
Among them was the preacher of that distinguished convent, father Fray
Diego del Aguila. To these, others from other convents added
themselves, and a member of the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb253"
href="#pb253" name="pb253">253</a>]</span>college of San Gregorio, of
whose great virtue an account will immediately be given. When the time
for beginning the voyage arrived, the thirteen members of the order
from the convent of San Estevan at Salamanca prostrated themselves on
the floor of the church, after thanks had been returned for the meal
which had been completed, and asked for the blessing of the superior
that they might begin their journey. This act aroused great devotion
among those who were present. When they had received the blessing, they
went in procession to the convent of novices, where they took their
cloaks and bags; and intoning the devout hymn of the Holy Spirit, they
began with His divine support upon this journey, with their staves and
hempen sandals, after the manner of persons who go on foot. They were
led by father Fray Diego del Aguila, the preacher of that convent at
the time, and an example of virtue in that city where he had preached
with great reputation for the four years preceding. Hence to see him
walking on foot, and on his way to regions so remote, was a thing which
caused great tenderness and devotion in those who knew him, and who saw
so devout and so humble an act, so determined a resignation, and such
contempt for the world. He labored much in the ship, hearing
confessions, and preaching and teaching; for as in voyages there are so
many kinds of people, there is need of all of these things, while many
of the people need them all at once, because they do not know the
doctrine which it is their duty to know and believe, and do not take
that care of their souls which they ought to take. Some of them do not
even desire to have such things spoken of, that their ignorance may not
be known; and hence there <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb254" href=
"#pb254" name="pb254">254</a>]</span>is much labor in teaching them,
and it is a great service to God not to refuse this labor.</p>
<p>[The member of the college of San Gregorio at Valladolid who came
with the rest of these religious was Fray Pedro Rodriguez, a native of
Montilla and a son of the convent of San Pablo at Cordoba. His
departure caused much grief. His parents loved him tenderly, for he
was, like Benjamin, the youngest and was very obedient and docile by
nature. The religious of his convent were grieved because they had seen
in him so notable a beginning in virtue and letters. In spite of the
efforts of fathers, kinsmen, and religious, father Fray Pedro
maintained his resolve. His virtues were very great, and he mortified
himself constantly. His last illness befell him when the vessel had
already come among these islands; and they were already at the port of
Ybalon, and were carrying him ashore that he might receive the
viaticum, when he lost consciousness. He had desired to be left in the
islands of the Ladrones, that he might serve as missionary; but he was
not permitted to do so, on account of the great difficulties which he
would have met with because of ignorance of the language. It may be
that father Fray Pedro would have overcome them; but such things ought
not to be left in the hands of a single person. The evil results which
follow are morally worse than the gain which may be expected, as has
been found out by experience since religious of the seraphic father St.
Francis have remained there. His body was taken to be buried in the
church of Casigura. He left behind him among his brethren the name of
saint.] <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb255" href="#pb255" name=

<h3 class="main">Other events which happened at this time in Japon and
the Philippinas</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">[The circumstances in Japon were such that many of the
converts were obliged to spend six, or eight, or even fifteen years
without confessing, while some of them had not seen a confessor within
forty years. Hence the fathers Fray Thomas and Fray Alonso were anxious
to go up into the country to continue the good work which they had
begun. The vicar-provincial, Fray Francisco de Morales, sent father
Fray Alonso de Mena to the kingdom of Fixen,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e1499src" href="#xd21e1499" name="xd21e1499src">49</a> where there
had been no church up to this year 1606. A certain captain, Francisco
Moreno Donoso, had taken some Franciscan fathers with him on a journey,
and on the voyage had been delivered from great danger by the
intercession of our Lady of the Rosary. He was therefore devoted to
this our Lady. Although the kingdom of Fixen is very near Nangasaqui,
the king had always been unwilling to admit preachers of Christianity;
but this king had a great regard for Captain Moreno Donoso, who went to
visit the king with father Fray Alonso; and the captain made the king
many gifts, refusing to accept <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb256"
href="#pb256" name="pb256">256</a>]</span>anything in return except a
chain. The king showed him such favor that the captain took advantage
of the opportunity to ask permission that father Fray Alonso might
establish convents and churches in the kingdom. The king was pleased to
grant it, insisting only that the sanction of a great bonze, named
Gaco, should first be secured; he was a native of Fixen, and was the
most highly regarded man in Japan because of his learning. The king
sent his own secretary to go before the bonze, to tell him of the
poverty, the penitence, the contempt for the things of this world, the
modesty, the humility, and the courteous behavior of the father. The
bonze, seeing that it was the pleasure of the king, said that such a
man might very well receive this permission. In conformity with it
three poor churches and houses were built&mdash;one in Famamachi under
the patronage of our Lady of the Rosary; the second in the city of
Caxima [<i>i.e.</i>, Kashima]. named for St. Vincent; and, after some
time, another one at the king&rsquo;s court [<i>i.e.</i>, Saga], for
which at that time permission had been refused. Father Fray Alonso and
his companion, when he had one, got the little they needed for their
support from Portuguese and Castilians in Nangasaqui, that they might
avoid asking for alms from the Japanese, and might thus give no
opportunity for the bonzes to complain against them, and to find a
pretext for sending them out of the country. Father Fray Alonso
remained in this kingdom; and the order persevered until the
persecution, when all the religious who had been hiding there were
ordered to depart from Japon. Father Fray Alonso found in this kingdom
some Japanese who had been baptized in other kingdoms, but had not been
well <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb257" href="#pb257" name=
"pb257">257</a>]</span>taught in the faith, or who had forgotten the
good teachings that they had received at their baptism. They were
guilty of much irregularity in their marriages; and some of them had
assumed to baptize others without knowing the essence of the baptismal
form, so that it was difficult to determine which of them had received
valid baptisms. These imperfectly prepared converts had also done harm
by endeavoring to sustain arguments against the opponents of
Christianity, and, being insufficiently grounded in the faith, they had
spread false impressions of the Christian religion. Notable cases of
conversion occurred, there being some instances well worthy of remark
in the court; and finally the sanctity of the life of the missionaries
caused them to be called <i>xaxino padre</i>, &ldquo;fathers who
despise the world.&rdquo; The father Fray Juan de Los Angeles, or
Rueda, came to live at Fixen in the following year, 1607.</p>
<p>In this year 1606 of which we have been speaking, there died at sea
father Fray Domingo de Nieva, who was on his way to act as procurator
of the province. He had labored much and well among the Indians of
Bataan and among the Chinese. Father Fray Domingo was a native of
Billoria in Campos, and a son of the convent of San Pablo at
Valladolid. He was a man of ability and of good will. When nearly all
the lecturers in theology from that convent, together with the
lecturers in arts, and many of their most able and learned disciples,
determined to go to the Philippinas, father Fray Domingo joined his
masters. He suffered his life long from headache. Being sent to Bataan
in company with three other fathers, he, as the youngest, had to carry
a very <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb258" href="#pb258" name=
"pb258">258</a>]</span>heavy burden of duties. He was fortunate enough
not to suffer from any further diseases, the Lord being pleased not to
add any to his constant headache. His mortification, fasting, and
discipline were very great. He wrote some devout tracts in the language
of the Indians, and some others in that of the Chinese. He had printed
for the Chinese in their language and characters an essay upon the
Christian life, with other brief tracts of prayer and meditation, in
preparation for the holy sacraments of confession and the sacred
communion. He wrote a practically new grammar of the Chinese language,
a vocabulary, a manual of confession, and many sermons, in order that
those who had to learn this language might find it less difficult. He
was prior of Manila; and in the third year of his priorate the news
arrived of the death of father Fray Pedro de San Vicente, who was going
to Espa&ntilde;a as definitor in the chapter general and as procurator
for this province. Since it was necessary to send another in his place,
father Fray Domingo received the appointment to the duty. Like his
predecessor, he died on the voyage from the islands to Mexico.]</p>

<h3 class="label">Chapter LXV</h3>
<h3 class="main">The foundation of Manavag in Pangasinan and the deaths
of some religious</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In the year 1605 the missionaries to Pangasinan, not
contented with the fruitful results of their labors in the level region
of that province, took under their charge the village of Manavag,
situated among the mountains at a considerable distance from the other
villages. The first entry into this village was made by the religious
of our father St. Augustine in the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb259"
href="#pb259" name="pb259">259</a>]</span>year 1600; they built there a
church named after St. Monica, and baptized some children. The village
was so small, however, that it was not possible for a religious to find
enough to do there to justify his continued residence; and accordingly
it was visited from Lingayen, the capital of that province, which was
at that time in their hands. It caused them a great deal of labor,
since they were obliged to travel three days if they went there by
water, and two if they went by land; and therefore it was seldom
visited, and little good resulted to the village. Inasmuch as the whole
population were heathen, they required much persuasion to lead them to
baptism, and a great deal of attention to their religious instruction.
On this account, those fathers placed a juridical renunciation of the
said village in the hands of the bishop, Don Fray Diego de Soria. The
bishop, being a religious of our order, asked his brethren to take
charge of this village, since there were in it many baptized children,
and no other body of religious could care for and guide them. The
bishop, in asking the religious to take this matter in charge, was
laying upon them no small burden; yet the need was almost extreme, and
the great labor brought with it great reward&mdash;for, as the apostle
says, each man shall be rewarded at the last judgment in proportion to
his labors. Hence they determined to assume the charge, and the
superior sent there father Fray Juan de San Jacintho,<a class="noteref"
id="xd21e1535src" href="#xd21e1535" name="xd21e1535src">50</a> a
devoted religious and an indefatigable laborer in the teaching
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb260" href="#pb260" name=
"pb260">260</a>]</span>of the Indians. He went to Manavag in the year
mentioned, and the fact was spread abroad among the neighboring
villages. On account of the great love which they had for the order,
and especially for the religious who was there (for he was like an
angel from heaven), some other hamlets were added to that one, and the
village of Manavag was made of reasonable size. The Negrillos and
Zambales who go about through those mountains were continually
harassing this village, partly because of their evil desires to kill
men, and partly for robbery. They often came down upon it with bows and
arrows, and with fire to burn the houses and the church which was
practically all of straw. They committed murders, and robbed women and
children. Those in the village being thus terrorized, and the men being
unable to prevent the evil, since their enemies came when they had gone
out into the fields, it was determined to take as patroness the Virgin
of the Rosary, that she might aid them in this need. They accordingly
dedicated a new church to her, and solemnized the dedication with many
baptisms of adult persons. Within a few months, there was not a heathen
within the village&mdash;a clear proof that the presence of heathen in
the country is due solely to a lack of missionaries. Wherever the
missionaries are, all are immediately baptized; and not only those of
that village which has the missionaries, but some of their neighbors
also, participate in the teaching of the religious, and in the favors
of our Lady of the Rosary. This is plain from a miracle which occurred
a few years after, and was verified before the vicar-general of this
country, who at that time was father Fray Pedro de Madalena. It
happened thus. Four <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb261" href="#pb261"
name="pb261">261</a>]</span>leguas from Manavag, in a village of
Ygolote Indians who inhabit some high mountain ridges, there lived an
Indian chief, a heathen, by the name of Dogarat, who used sometimes to
go down to the village of Manavag, and to listen out of curiosity to
the preaching of the religious. Since the matters of our faith are
truly divine, the Indian began to incline toward them, and even toward
becoming a Christian. He therefore learned the prayers, and knew them
by heart; and the only thing which held him back was the necessity of
leaving his vassals and his kinsmen if he was baptized, and going away
from the washings in a river of his village, where they used to gather
grains of gold, which come down with the water from those hills and
ridges where they are formed. God our Lord, to draw him to the precious
waters of baptism, brought upon him a severe illness. When he felt the
misery of this disease, he sent to call the religious who was at that
time in Manavag, father Fray Thomas Gutierrez, who came to his village,
called Ambayaban, and visited the sick Indian, giving him thorough
instruction in the matters of our holy faith. When he was thoroughly
prepared he baptized him and named him Domingo. By the aid of the Lord
he recovered, and used to attend church on feast days. He asked for a
rosary, which the religious gave him with a direction to say the
prayers of the rosary every day, that the Sovereign Lady might aid him.
He went out hunting once; and in order that the rosary, which he always
wore about his neck, might not interfere with him or be broken by
catching in a branch, he took it off and hung it on a tree, and with it
a little purse in which he was carrying a trifle of gold. It happened
soon <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb262" href="#pb262" name=
"pb262">262</a>]</span>after that some Indians set fire to the mountain
to frighten out the game. The fire kindled the tree where the rosary
was hanging, and burnt it all to ashes. Some time afterward Don Domingo
came back for his rosary, and discovered the destruction which the fire
had wrought, and the tree in ashes. As he was looking among them he
found his rosary entire and unhurt, while everything else was burnt up,
and the purse and the gold were consumed, though they were close to the
rosary, which did not show a sign of fire. The Indian, amazed, went and
told his story to father Fray Thomas, who for a memorial of this marvel
kept the miraculous rosary among the treasures of the church, giving
the Indian another in its place. There it remained, in token of the
esteem and respect which our Lady willed that the fire should pay to
her holy rosary.</p>
<p>[In the month of June, 1607, father Fray Juan Baptista Gacet ended
his labors happily in the convent of Sancto Domingo at Manila. He was a
son of the convent of Preachers at Valencia, and a beloved disciple of
St. Luis Beltran, whom he succeeded in the office of master of novices
at Valencia. When St. Luis returned from the Indias, the Lord moved
father Fray Juan to go to them, as he desired to reap a harvest of
souls, and feared that they might strive to make him superior in his
own province. He received the approval of St. Luis, and went to the
Indias at the time when master Fray Alonso Bayllo went out from his
convent of Murcia, by command of our lord the king and of the general
of the order, to divide the province of Vaxac from that of Sanctiago de
Mexico. Being threatened with a superiorship in the province of Vaxac,
father Fray <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb263" href="#pb263" name=
"pb263">263</a>]</span>Juan did what he could to avoid it. When a
company of religious under the leadership of father Fray Pedro de
Ledesma passed through Nueva Espa&ntilde;a on their way to the
Philippinas, father Fray Juan decided to accompany them, though he was
already of venerable age; and he reached Manila in 1596. Here he was
greatly honored, and, being too old to learn the Indian languages, was
retained in the convent of Manila to act as confessor and spiritual
guide to a number of devout persons in the city. He was made definitor
in the first provincial chapter, and was later obliged to accept the
office of prior&mdash;having no other country to flee to, as he had
fled from Espa&ntilde;a to the Indias, and thence to the Philippinas,
to avoid this elevation. He was given to devout exercises and to
prayer, reading often from some devout book, usually from St. John
Climachus, and afterward discussing the passage, and making it the
basis of devout meditation. After leaving the office of prior, he
returned to his life of devotion and abstraction.</p>
<p>On the twentieth of July in the same year, father Fray Miguel de Oro
ended his life in the province of Nueva Segovia. He was a native of
Carrion de Los Condes; and he took the habit and professed in San Pablo
at Valladolid. He afterward went to the religious province of
Guatemala, where he remained for some years, but afterward returned to
Espa&ntilde;a. In 1599 the plague attacked all Espa&ntilde;a and raged
with especial violence in Valladolid. Father Fray Miguel, with four
other religious of our order, devoted himself to the care of those who
were plague-stricken. After the plague he retired to the convent of La
Pe&ntilde;a de Francia; but his memory <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb264" href="#pb264" name="pb264">264</a>]</span>was constantly
stirred by the recollection of his service among the Indians, and in
1601 he went with some other religious to Manila. He was assigned to
the province of Nueva Segovia, where, although on account of his great
age he was unable to learn the language, his holy example was of great
value. He was of great help and comfort to the minister whom he
accompanied, doing all that he could to make it possible for the
minister (who knew the language) to work among the Indians, and to
write in the Indian language compositions and spiritual exercises,
which were of service to the ministers that came after them. He used to
wear next his skin a thick chain, weighing ten libras; and, that the
other brethren might not perceive the marks of it on his tunics, he
used to take care to wash and dry them apart. He died as a result of a
fever caused by the heat of the sun. Father Fray Miguel was of swarthy
complexion, with black and very prominent eyes which inspired fear.
After his death he remained handsome, fair, and rosy, which caused
those present to wonder-all supposing that these were signs of the
glory which his soul already enjoyed.]</p>

<h3 class="label">Chapter LXVI</h3>
<h3 class="main">The establishment of two churches in Nueva
Segovia</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In the month of August, 1607, at the octave of the
Assumption of our Lady, a church was erected in the village of
Nalfotan, the chief village among those which are called the villages
of Malagueg [<i>i.e.</i>, Mala&uacute;eg] in Nueva Segovia. This church
had the name and was under the patronage of St. Raymond. The Indians of
these villages were and are courageous <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb265" href="#pb265" name="pb265">265</a>]</span>and warlike. Hence
before the coming of the faith they were constantly at war among
themselves and with their neighbors, being men of fierce mind and lofty
courage, and highly prizing their valor, strength and spirit, an
inheritance left to them by their ancestors. Thus they and their
neighbors of Gatarang and Talapa, with whom they were very closely
related, gave the Spaniards a great deal of trouble, and were feared
and still are feared by the other Indians of that large province. In
the village called Nalfotan the chief and lord at this time was a young
man named Pagulayan, to whom our Lord, in addition to high rank, great
wealth, and courage, had given a quiet and peaceful disposition. He was
a friend of peace and of the public weal&mdash;[seeking not only] his
own advantage, but that of his people, and striving to secure what he
recognized as good; and in him ran side by side the love of peace, and
military spirit and courage&mdash;in which he was distinguished and
eminent, and for which he was therefore feared by his enemies. God our
Lord, so far as we can judge, had predestinated him for Himself; and
this he showed by the great affection with which he listened to matters
dealing with the service of God, even when he was a heathen and was
living among barbarians, idolaters and demons, such as were all his
vassals. When he heard that the Ytabes Indians, his neighbors, had
religious of St. Dominic who taught them a sure and certain road to
salvation, and to the gaining of perpetual happiness for the soul in
heaven by serving God in peace and quietude, he strove with all his
heart to enjoy so great a good. He discussed the matter with his
Indians, and with their approval went down many times to the city of
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb266" href="#pb266" name=
"pb266">266</a>]</span>the Spaniards to carry out his religious
purpose, endeavoring to have the father provincial, Fray Miguel de San
Jacintho, give him a religious for his village. The provincial would
have rejoiced to give him one; but those whom he had were so busy, and
he had already withdrawn so many in response to such requests, that he
was unable to satisfy this good desire, except with the hope that a
missionary would be provided there as soon as the religious had come
whom he was expecting from Espa&ntilde;a. The good Pagulayan, although
he was somewhat consoled, did not cease to complain, with feeling, that
he had been unable to bring to his village the good which he desired
for it. As he was unable to obtain a religious, he took with him a
Christian child from among those who were being taught the Christian
doctrine in the church, that the boy might instruct him until a father
should come who could complete and perfect his teaching. Nay, more: he
and his people, having confidence in the promise which had been given
them, erected a church in their village that they might influence the
religious [to go there], and have that stronger reason for supplying a
minister to them rather than to other villages which had no church. All
this greatly affected the religious; and finally, in August of this
year [1607], father Fray Pedro de Sancto Thomas<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e1569src" href="#xd21e1569" name="xd21e1569src">51</a> went there
and found the church already built, and the whole village&mdash;men,
women, and children&mdash;gathered on purpose to receive him, as they
did with great joy and the exhibition of much content. This caused like
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb267" href="#pb267" name=
"pb267">267</a>]</span>content in the soul of father Fray Pedro, who
giving many thanks to the Lord, whose work this was, firmly resolved to
labor with all his strength in this vineyard which seemed to bear fruit
before it was cultivated. Father Fray Pedro was very well suited to
begin a conversion like this; for he was so simple and affable that the
most remote barbarians, if they talked with him, were compelled to love
him. He was of a very gentle nature, and extremely open-hearted, being
entirely free from any duplicity or deceit, and acting in all things
with the bowels of charity. This is the greatest snare to catch love
which may be set for men. Hence they received him as if he came from
heaven, and at the beginning they listened to him and obeyed him with
great zeal. The devil at these things suffered from rage and the worst
pains of hell, as he saw himself losing, all at once, villages which
had been his for so many ages. Hence by the means of a sorceress, a
priestess of his, named Caquenga, he began to disturb the Indians, to
whom this wicked woman said such things that many determined to follow
the rites of their ancestors and not to receive the teaching of the
divine law. So devilish was this cursed anitera that she kept stirring
up some of them against the religious, while at the same time with
those who wished to keep him she pretended to be on their side; thus
she deceived them all, especially those who were influenced by their
zeal for ancient superstitions. Hence they themselves killed their
fowls and the swine which they had bred, tore down their houses, and
cut down their palm-groves, in which their principal wealth consisted;
and, crying out, &ldquo;Liberty!&rdquo; they fled to the mountains.
Here they joined those who had hitherto been <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb268" href="#pb268" name=
"pb268">268</a>]</span>their enemies, that they might be more in number
and might bring a greater multitude of weapons against a solitary friar
who went unarmed, and whom they had invited to their village with such
urgency, and received with such joy; and against whom they had no
complaint except simply that he preached to them the law of God and the
gospel of peace, at their own invitation, and that a most earnest
invitation. Pagulayan, with some of his vassals, was constantly at the
side of Fray Pedro&mdash;who, being secure in his own conscience, was
not intimidated, but strove to bring back those who had revolted.
Seeking for means of speaking to them, he determined to send an Indian
who should arrange in his behalf for a conference; and who should
promise the chief of the revolted ones, whose name was Furaganan, that
the Spaniards who were &iexcl;n the city of Nueva Segovia would not
punish him for what he had done. That the Indian might feel safe and
might believe him, he gave the man a relic of St. Thomas to carry; for
among them there was no one who knew how to read or write, because they
had no letters of their own, so that he was unable to give him a
letter, or any other token better known as coming from the father.
This, however, sufficed to cause Furaganan to listen to the messenger
without ill-treating him; and he agreed to meet the religious at a
certain place and on an appointed day. As a token of fidelity and
peace, Furaganan sent his bararao&mdash;a dagger with which they stab
close at hand, and can easily cut off a head&mdash;that it might be put
in the hands of the religious. They met on the assigned day; and the
Indian, annoyed with Caquenga, who had caused the disturbance among
them, immediately <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb269" href="#pb269"
name="pb269">269</a>]</span>joined the party of the religious against
whom she had caused them to rebel. Furaganan asked them to give him
this Indian anitera as a slave, alleging that she had been a slave of
his mother, and that in this way and no other could quiet be restored,
because he could not suffer that this intriguing slave-woman should,
merely through her crafty acts, be more esteemed by the Spaniards than
were the chiefs. She was, he said, full of duplicity, having remained
with Pagulayan that she might be able to say afterward to the Spaniards
that she was not at fault for the uprising&mdash;although, in point of
fact, she had been the cause of it. Fray Pedro promised to look after
this business with great diligence, and to do what should be best. The
Indian departed, apparently in peace; but the others did not continue
in that frame of mind. At midnight, while the religious was reciting
the matins, on the first Sunday of Advent, and when he had come to the
first response, the insurgents set fire to the church, thus alarming
those who had remained in the village, and causing them to take flight.
Pagulayan came to father Fray Pedro, and, acting as his guide, put him
on a safe road, carrying him at times on his shoulders across creeks
and rivers on the road which they followed. At dawn they halted in a
thicket, whence the father went to a little village farther down,
because the place where they were was not safe. Here Pagulayan carried
the robes from the sacristy, and father Fray Pedro put them as well as
he could into a chest, being obliged to leave out a canvas of our Lady,
which on account of its size the chest would not hold. Leaving it
there, he went on to the village of Pia, where there was a religious
with many Christians, and where the <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb270" href="#pb270" name="pb270">270</a>]</span>people were peaceful.
The insurgents went straight down to the village where the chest and
the picture were; and, opening the chest, they took out the ornaments,
the chalice, and all the rest, and profaned everything. They cut the
ornaments of the mass into pieces, to make head-cloths and ribbons.
They tore the leaves out of the missal, and drank out of the chalice,
like a godless race governed by the devil. Taking the image painted on
the canvas, they set it up as a target for their lances. One of them
blasphemously said: &ldquo;This, the fathers tell us, is the mother of
God; if this were truth, our lances would draw blood, and since she
sheds none, it is all trickery and deceit.&rdquo; The savage said this
when he was throwing his lance at the image, and his audacity did not
remain without its punishment, for he was soon after condemned to the
galleys; and here, in addition to the ordinary hardships suffered in
them, he was maltreated by all the other galley slaves when they
learned that his crime had been committed against our Lady. They struck
him, buffeted him, kicked him, and abused him with words as an enemy of
the Virgin; and in this state he died, passing from the wretched life
of the galleys to eternal death in hell.</p>
<p>In this same year the Indians of Zimbuey, in the level part of La
Yrraya in the same province, rose and murdered their encomendero Luis
Henriquez, angered because he had treated them during the previous year
with more rigor than was proper. There was no religious here. The
Indians, in fear of like severity during the present year, had mutinied
against the encomendero and thrust him through with a lance. Out of his
shin-bones they made steps to go up to the house of their chief&mdash;a
piece of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb271" href="#pb271" name=
"pb271">271</a>]</span>savagery such as might be expected from enraged
Indians. Information of these two risings was sent to the governor of
Manila, who sent out the sargento-mayor Christobal de Azcueta with a
sufficient number of soldiers. He ascertained the facts in both cases
and brought out the truth clearly&mdash;namely, that the excesses of
the dead encomendero had caused the Indians of his encomienda at
Zimbuey to rise, and that the intrigues of Caquenga had roused the
Indians of Malagueg. The latter, conscious of their fault, came to the
city of Nueva Segovia to beg that the religious might return to them;
and father Fray Pedro de Sancto Thomas returned with them. He had
greater confidence in the many hopes which he had, for many of them,
that they would be good and faithful Christians, than resentment for
the wrongs which he had received from others. All this disturbance came
to an end, and he built convents and churches and baptized many. In
course of time all those people were baptized. Pagulayan was named
Luis, and one of his sisters was named Luysa Balinan. They were always
very brotherly and sisterly in all things, especially in following
virtue. They remained very firm in the faith, and have aided much to
bring their Indians to embrace it. They lived according to the
teachings of the faith, giving a noble example in this respect, and
obviously surpassing all those of their land in everything that has to
do with virtue and the service of God. They were, during all their
lives, the support of the mission, the comfort of the religious, and
generous honorers of their church&mdash;upon the adornment of which
they spent freely in proportion to their means, giving silver lamps and
other very rich ornaments for the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb272"
href="#pb272" name="pb272">272</a>]</span>service and beautifying of
the church. Nor did they forget the poor, not only of their own
village, but of the others, who very often come to this one to find
food, since this is generally the village where food is most abundant.
Don Luis Pagulayan died while young, in the year 1620. His death was
much regretted and deplored, as it still is both by the religious and
by his Indians, and much more by his sister, Do&ntilde;a Luysa Balinan.
She is yet living, and perseveres in holy customs and in laudable acts
of all the virtues; for she wears hair shirts underneath her dress as a
married chieftainess, is constantly in the church, and is very frequent
in her confessions and communions. She is very careful that not only
those of her household (who are many) but all of the
village&mdash;which is one of the largest in the province of Nueva
Segovia&mdash;should carefully observe the law of God and hear and
learn the Catholic doctrine. This she herself ordinarily teaches, and
teaches well, for she has had much practice in this office, so that she
greatly aids the ministers. A few years ago, there was in this province
a great famine; and Do&ntilde;a Luisa having very fertile land, from
which she might have made a great profit, preferred to offer it to
Christ through His poor. Hence she spent it all upon them, directing
all the poor to come every day to her for their food, as was done. In
any tumult or disturbance that may arise, she is one from whom the
religious learn with perfect certainty the truth of what has happened;
and by her assistance (for she is very prudent) the remedy is obtained.
The Lord watches over her and prospers her in all things&mdash;not only
spiritual, in which she surpasses, but also temporal, for she is one of
the richest persons that there <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb273"
href="#pb273" name="pb273">273</a>]</span>are in this province. When
some superstitious performances were carried on here by some of the
chiefs, she immediately informed the religious. When he asked her if
she dared to declare the matter before the guilty persons, that in this
way the evil might be demonstrated and cured, she replied that she
would venture, even though they should give her poison; for they were
unable to avenge themselves in any other way, and she had reason to
expect them to do this. Such is the spirit and courage with which she
serves the Lord and strives for the good of her fellow-men; and so
little does she esteem life when there is an opportunity for her to
venture it for such a noble end. In the year 1626, the names of those
entered in the records of baptism in this church of Nalfotan were
counted. The total was found to be four thousand six hundred and
seventy, in addition to those baptized in sickness, who were many; and
all this rich harvest was reaped in a village which eighteen years ago
was composed wholly of heathen.</p>
<p>At the end of this year, 1607, another church was built in December,
on Innocents&rsquo; day, in a village of the same province named Yguig,
two days&rsquo; journey up the river from the city of the Spaniards.
The encomendero had collected his tribute from these Indians with great
care; but he had given no attention to providing them with Christian
instruction, as God and the king commanded him. The Lord, who overlooks
many other grievous sins, was unwilling to let this pass without
chastisement; but the punishment which He gave the encomendero was that
of a kind father, and was inflicted outside of his clothes&mdash;that
is to say, it fell only upon his wealth, which, when it is guiltily
acquired, shall not profit. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb274" href=
"#pb274" name="pb274">274</a>]</span>This encomendero lost all; and
when these misfortunes came upon him, one after the other, he perceived
that they did not come by chance, and saw what it was with which the
Lord might be angry. This was his supporting idolatry and the service
of the devil in this village, by his mere failure to provide Christian
instruction in it, as was his duty. He repented of what he had hitherto
done, and vowed to provide in this village the teaching of the true
God, and a religious to preach and teach it. In this year he asked for
the religious from the father provincial, Fray Miguel de San Jacintho,
and one was given him. Since there was a discussion as to what patron
this new church should be given, many slips with the names of saints
upon them were placed in a vessel. Three times the name of Sanctiago,
patron of the Espa&ntilde;as, came out; and hence the church was given
this name, which has been retained in this village of Yguig. This has
been done in spite of the fact that, on account of great inundations
and floods of the river, it has been necessary to build the church on
four separate sites&mdash;the first three having been overflowed,
although it did not appear possible that the river should reach land
situated so high. This river, however, is very large; and its floods
are so extreme that they overflowed these eminences, until the church
was finally placed where it now is, which is upon a very high hill.
Here it enjoys without disturbance the fresh breezes, and is safe
against any flood. Among all these changes and difficulties, this tribe
would have been scattered and their village destroyed, if the religious
had not sustained them with alms and charities. They received much
assistance from the Indian chiefs, in particular from one <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb275" href="#pb275" name="pb275">275</a>]</span>who
far surpassed the others in Christian zeal and in fidelity to God, the
church, and the Spaniards. The Lord has wrought him great and apparent
benefits for this. One was as follows. He went for many days under a
temptation of the devil to kill another Indian chief, who had wrought
him a great wrong; and could not rest by day or by night for thinking
how he might obtain satisfaction against the guilty man. Now he thought
of these plans, now of those, and was in such disquiet that he could
not conceal the matter. The religious came to a knowledge of this,
called him aside, and rebuked him earnestly, for his guilt and the
great sin which he was designing, which was entirely contrary to the
laws which should govern a Christian, such as he was, who is bound to
love his enemies. It was even contrary to the principles of his rank
and his chieftainship for him to desire to commit a murder. Don
Ambrosio Luppo (as this Indian was named) responded, weeping freely:
&ldquo;Would to God, father, that you might see my heart, in order that
you might understand well how much I suffer from the deed of this man,
and might also see plainly how great an impression your teachings have
made upon me. If I had not looked to God for some way of following your
teachings, would this man have had his head on his shoulders so long?
But I pardoned him because God pardoned me; and from that time I have
been calm, and more devout than before.&rdquo; He received another
benefit. He and his wife much desired to have children, but, though
they had lived for many years together, they had now passed their
youth, and had no children. They communicated their desire to the
father, and he advised them what they ought to do, saying: <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb276" href="#pb276" name=
"pb276">276</a>]</span>&ldquo;When good Spaniards feel these desires,
they offer particular devotion to the mother of God and to other great
saints&rdquo;&mdash;naming some who are of most signal assistance in
such cases&mdash;&ldquo;and they go to the churches and offer prayers
before their images, that they may intercede with God who can do all
things. In this way they many times attain what they desire.&rdquo;
&ldquo;All this will we do very willingly,&rdquo; answered husband and
wife; &ldquo;but what shall we say in our prayer after we have recited
the <i>Paternoster</i> and the <i>Ave Maria</i>?&rdquo; The religious
taught them what they ought to say and what prayers they ought to make
to our Lady, briefly indicating to her the desire which they had, and
offering to her service the fruit of the blessing which they might
attain by their prayers. This they did, going with their petition to
the Lady of the Rosary which was in their church. A year later they had
a son, to whom the religious, in memory of that which had been agreed
upon, gave the name of Juan de Sancta Maria. The parents recognized him
as a gift from our Lady. Afterward this same Lady, by means of this
same religious, restored the child to complete health in an instant,
when it was almost at the point of death. This she did for the comfort
of the parents, for it seemed as if they would follow it out of sorrow.
On many other occasions she has come to their help; and the Lord has
rewarded them with a generous hand for the faith and the good services
which, since they became Christians, they have done and are doing.

<h3 class="label">Chapter LXVII</h3>
<h3 class="main">The election as provincial of father Fray Baltasar
Fort, the martyrdom of the holy Leon, and events in the province.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In April, 1608, the electors, assembled in the convent
of Sancto Domingo at Manila, chose as provincial father Fray Baltasar
Fort, minister of the holy gospel in the province of Pangasinan. He was
by habit and profession a son of the convent of San Estevan at
Salamanca, and adopted into that of the Preachers in Valencia, his
native land, whence he came to this province in the year 1602. He was
at this time prior of the convent. He was of a character such that all
necessary qualities for so high an office were united in him; and hence
his election was very agreeable to all, both religious and lay, because
he was greatly loved and reverenced by all&mdash;not only of his own
religious order, but also of the others. In this chapter were accepted
the houses which had been newly formed in Japon, Pangasinan, and Nueva
Segovia, an account of which has been given in the two preceding
chapters. What had been at other times ordained and commanded was
recalled to mind&mdash;namely, that in our conversations we should
speak constantly of God, a subject which is never exhausted, is never
wearisome to a good man, is edifying to all, and keeps the religious in
the fulfilment of the obligations that belong to their estate.</p>
<p>[At this time the fathers who were laboring for the good of the
natives of Japon had a joyful day in seeing the martyrdom of a person
who had been <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb278" href="#pb278" name=
"pb278">278</a>]</span>brought to the faith, instructed, and baptized
by their ministry; and in whom the faith had struck so deep roots that
he yielded fruit an hundred fold, according to the gospel, by suffering
martyrdom within four months after becoming a Christian. Having been
baptized on July 22, 1608, he was decapitated for his confession of
faith on the seventeenth of November in the same year, in the kingdom
of Satzuma, his native country. There were laws of the emperor, and
also of the actual king of that region, that no soldier or person of
rank should be baptized, since it was believed that the strength of
these persons would be weakened if they gave up their obligations to
those deities from whom victory was expected. In spite of this law,
many soldiers and persons of rank were baptized, among them Xichiyemon,
a youth of high rank. He received baptism from the hands of father Fray
Joseph de San Jacintho, who warned him of the tumult which his baptism
would arouse, and of the destruction of his soul which would follow if
he were to renounce his baptism. He was so determined and courageous
that the father baptized him by the name of Leon. His devotion was such
that his conversion could not long be hidden; and, when it was known,
the valiant Leon was obliged to resist the supplications of his
superior officers, his friends, and his relatives, who represented to
him the shame which he would bring upon his family if he should die by
the hands of the executioner. This is a thing above measure infamous in
Japon, because all malefactors of rank who are condemned to death cut
open their own abdomens, and wound their bowels with their own knives
[<i>catanas</i>], and thus kill themselves, that they may <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb279" href="#pb279" name="pb279">279</a>]</span>not
die at the hands of another.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1621src"
href="#xd21e1621" name="xd21e1621src">52</a> His obligations to his
wife and children, and his duties of obedience as a soldier, were
insisted upon; but he remained resolved to die as a Christian, not
taking his own life, but offering it. He was not imprisoned, and
visited his spiritual father, Fray Juan Joseph de San Jacintho, in a
little village a quarter of a legua from Fira&ccedil;a. At the
appointed time he dressed himself in new white clothes, washed his
head, and gird on two swords. He then went to the cross-roads where he
was to suffer, and died with a rosary in his hand and a little picture
of the descent from the cross on his bosom. His holy body was exhumed
by the Christians, and was kept by the fathers of St. Dominic, who
afterward, when they were driven from the country, took it with them to
Manila and placed it in the chapel of the relics. The tyrant commanded
that Leon&rsquo;s wife and eldest son should suffer death, because they
had been unable to persuade him to recant. Pablo, Leon&rsquo;s friend,
who was accused at the same time, was not so happy as he, but was
merely banished from the kingdom of Satzuma.</p>
<p>On the eleventh of April in this year (<i>i.e.</i>, 1609) there
arrived at Manila some religious from the number of those who were
brought from Espa&ntilde;a to this province by father Fray Gabriel de
Quiroga. He died on the voyage before he reached Mexico, and most of
the others were scattered, and remained in Nueva Espa&ntilde;a. Father
Fray Gabriel was a son of our convent at Oca&ntilde;a. He was a great
preacher, and had come to this province in 1594. He was in <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb280" href="#pb280" name="pb280">280</a>]</span>the
ministry to the Chinese; being unable to learn the language on account
of his advanced age, and being in ill health, he returned to
Espa&ntilde;a. Here he felt scruples at having left the province of the
Philippinas, and asked permission of the most reverend general to
return to it with a company of religious. In 1607 he gathered a company
in Sevilla, but was unable to come for lack of a fleet. Later in the
same year, learning that six pataches were being prepared for the
voyage, he arranged to reassemble the religious and to take them in
these vessels, though he had already been appointed bishop of Caceres.
He quickly got together thirty associates, taking the risk of sailing
in December. The storms were so furious, and the asthma from which the
bishop suffered was so severe, that he departed this life on the way.
Of all those who came with him only eight completed the voyage which
they had begun.</p>
<p>The success of the religious in Satzuma during the six years which
they had spent in that kingdom aroused the tono, who was persuaded by
the devil and his servants the bonzes to expel the fathers from his
country. The case of the holy martyr Leon contributed to influence the
tono. It was said in that kingdom that no one ever failed to do what
his lords commanded him, and hence such disobedience as that of Leon
was regarded as dangerous to the state. The bonzes particularly were
bitter against the Christians, who despised the deity whom they
worshiped.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1645src" href="#xd21e1645" name=
"xd21e1645src">53</a> All the cases of misfortune and all the downfalls
which had happened to Christian princes <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb281" href="#pb281" name="pb281">281</a>]</span>within a few years
were referred to their belief, although the misfortunes of the heathen
princes had been much more numerous. As the king of Satzuma was at this
time actually preparing for a war of conquest against the islands of
the Leuquios,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1650src" href="#xd21e1650"
name="xd21e1650src">54</a> he was greatly impressed by these
reasonings. He was also disgusted because no vessels had come from
Manila to this country, the desire for trade having been his chief
object in sending for religious. The king of Satzuma sought for some
pretext for expelling the father, without finding any. In the month of
August, he sent word to them that the emperor complained because the
Spanish religious in his country had never appeared before him. This
was only a pretext to get the religious out of the country. There were
at that time in all Japan, outside of Nangasaqui, not more than three
churches licensed by the emperor: one in Meyaco, of the fathers of the
Society; a second in Yendo, of the Franciscan fathers; and a third in
Ozaca, of the Society. All the rest were practically in concealment,
and had license only from the tonos or kings. The emperor, though he
knew this, paid little attention to the matter. The fathers, however,
were able to say that father Fray Alonso de Mena had visited the
emperor, and had received license from him for the stay in Japan of the
rest of the fathers. Still, thinking that they might do well to appear
before the emperor, they decided to follow the suggestion of the tono,
and father Fray Francisco de Morales went directly to visit him and was
kindly received. Before father <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb282"
href="#pb282" name="pb282">282</a>]</span>Fray Francisco returned, the
tono gave commands that all the Christians should recant, and exiled
those who refused to obey, confiscating their goods. When this
happened, there were in Satzuma only the fathers Fray Joseph de San
Jacintho and Fray Jacintho Orfanel. Father Fray Joseph went directly to
appear before the old tono, and was received with much apparent
courtesy, which was a mere cloak for the evil which he was preparing to
execute. The father also desired to go to visit the young tono, but was
advised that he could do no good; and therefore he went from village to
village, strengthening and encouraging the converts. He and father Fray
Jacintho, happening to be both at once within the convent, the governor
forbade the religious to leave the church, and prohibited the
Christians from going to it, hoping thus to prevent the religious from
receiving any support. There was only one half-leprous boy, named Juan,
who succored them at this time. When he went to buy what they needed,
the people paid no attention to his coming and going, because of his
being afflicted in this way.]</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">[The kingdom of Japon is subject to constant changes
and novelties, as may be known by those who have lived in it, and by
those who have read what historians have to say of it. Although the
plague of inconstancy is very common among all heathen, the Japanese
are particularly subject to it. It is not to be wondered at that the
king of Satzuma, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb283" href="#pb283"
name="pb283">283</a>]</span>after all that he had done to bring
religious from St. Dominic to Manila, should have expelled them without
any cause. The natural inconstancy of this race is sufficient
explanation for his conduct. St. Francis Xavier was expelled from the
same kingdom of Satzuma, as he was afterwards from the country of
Yamagu&ccedil;u,<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1665src" href="#xd21e1665"
name="xd21e1665src">55</a> whence he fled to the kingdom of Firando. As
early as the year 1555, the heathen Japanese believed that so soon as
the faith should enter their country the kingdom would be destroyed;
and in the following year the city of Amaguchi was destroyed, and there
was a great persecution. In the year 1564 there was another
persecution, even more severe, in Meaco, the imperial court. Father
Cosme de Torres was obliged to leave there and to go to the kingdom of
Bungo. In Firando the churches were overthrown, and the emperor
Nabunanga imprisoned Father Argentino<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e1670src" href="#xd21e1670" name="xd21e1670src">56</a> and his
associate, refusing to release them until he received, as a ransom,
from the most noble and Catholic Don Justo the fortress called Tayca
Yama.<a class="noteref" id="xd21e1679src" href="#xd21e1679" name=
"xd21e1679src">57</a> In 1599 the Taico [<i>i.e.</i>, Iyeyasu] banished
by public edict all the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb284" href=
"#pb284" name="pb284">284</a>]</span>religious there were in Japon (all
of whom were then Jesuits), declaring that all Christians were his
enemies; but soon after he granted to father Fray Juan Cobo&mdash;a
religious of St. Dominic, who had come from Manila as
ambassador&mdash;that he, and religious of the Society or of any other
order, might preach and make converts in Japon. The sons of the
seraphic father St. Francis went, under this permission, in 1593, and
were kindly received; but very soon afterward commands were given to
crucify them, as preachers of the gospel. Father Fray Francisco de
Morales felt that conditions were such that it was necessary to comply,
and began by taking down the church and looking for boats to carry it
in; for it was fitted together with grooves, without nails, and could
be, used elsewhere. They removed for a time to Meyaco, and soon
afterwards to the city of Ozaca. In the erection of both churches they
were bitterly opposed by the members of the other religious orders,
although the others could not serve the twentieth or the thirtieth part
of the people of those cities. The Japanese banished from Satzuma
suffered greatly. Among this people banishment is often worse than
death, which is not greatly feared by them. Banishment is generally
accompanied with a loss of their goods, so that those who are noble and
rich are by it instantly reduced to poverty and drudgery. The fathers
carried away their vestments, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb285"
href="#pb285" name="pb285">285</a>]</span>the timber of the church, and
the body of the holy martyr Leon, removing them to Nangasaqui. Father
Fray Francisco also carried with him the lepers of the hospital which
he had before his house, that they might not be left in the power of
wolves. In the meantime, the affairs of Christianity went on
prosperously in the kingdom of Fixen. In July, 1609, father Fray Juan
de Sancto Thomas, who sent the first religious to Japon when he was
provincial, came to Japon as vicar-provincial, bringing with him as his
associate brother Fray Antonio de San Vicente. He labored much and
successfully in Fixen, and the Lord showed the fathers grace by
enabling them to baptize many whom He had predestinated at the point of
death. There were especially many cases of baptism of new-born
children, whom the parents intended to kill, or left to drown in the
river.]</p>
<p>One day&rsquo;s journey up the river from Abulug, in the province of
Nueva Segovia, there is a village named Fotol in the midst of a number
of other smaller villages, as is customary among the mountains. When
these villages were visited for the purpose of collecting tribute, the
religious was accustomed to go along that he might be there
conveniently to give them some knowledge of the law of God, and strive
to bring them to a love of the faith by which they might be saved. This
diligence, although it was exercised so seldom&mdash;only once a
year&mdash;was yet not in vain; for the words of the gospel sown in the
hearts of these heathen took root and caused them to go down [the
river], voluntarily, for the purpose of seeking a preacher to live
among them, to teach, direct, and baptize them. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb286" href="#pb286" name=
"pb286">286</a>]</span>Father Fray Miguel de San Jacintho, vicar of
Abulug, sent there father Fray Diego Carlos.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd21e1702src" href="#xd21e1702" name="xd21e1702src">58</a> The
Spaniards did not dare to visit the village when they collected the
tribute, except in numbers and with arms. On this account, and because
they were surrounded by mountaineers who were heathen, untamed, and
ferocious, it seemed to the Christian Indians of Abulug that the
religious ought not to go without a guard to protect his life; but
since the order given by our Lord Jesus Christ is not such, but directs
that His preachers should go as sheep among wolves, father Fray Diego
would not receive the advice given him by these Indians, though they
were friendly; and departed alone with his associate, as a preacher of
peace and of the law of love. All the Indians, great and small, came
out to receive them with great joy; and the religious immediately began
to preach to them and to teach them. In a short time they did a great
work, and baptized not only those of this village, but also those who
dwelt near there. They left their old sites and, gathering in this one,
formed a new settlement. The church was built under the patronage of
our Lady of the Rosary, and here the Christian faith went on
flourishing until the devil, hating so much good, disturbed them and
caused them to fall away for a time&mdash;to their great harm,
spiritual and temporal; though afterward, recognizing their error, they
returned to their obedience to their Creator, as will be told
hereafter. Almost in the same manner, and following <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb287" href="#pb287" name="pb287">287</a>]</span>the
same course, another church was built at this time in the high region
at the head of the great river, six days&rsquo; journey from the city
of the Spaniards, in a village named Batavag. Here father Fray Luis
Flores, who was afterward a holy martyr in Japon, gathered together
seven little hamlets, making one very peaceful one. He preached to
them, taught them, and baptized many, without receiving any other
assistance in all this than that which the Lord promises those who, for
love of Him and from zeal for souls, go alone, disarmed, and in
gentleness among heathen. To such no evil can happen, since, if the
heathen hear the teaching and are converted, all is happiness and joy
both in heaven and for the preachers, since the sinners are converted;
while if they refuse to admit them, or if, when the preachers are
admitted, the heathen do not become converts, the preachers have a
certain reward, as the Lord has promised. This reward will be much
greater if the heathen, in addition to refusing to be converted, treat
them ill, or take their lives from them, for the sake of the Lord whom
they preach. Therefore in this as in all the other conversions the
religious have always gone alone, unarmed, and in poverty, but sure
that they are to suffer no evil. The results in Batavag were very good,
although they did not last many years because, desirous of a greater
laxity of life than the divine law permits, the natives went up into
the neighboring mountain, apostatizing from the faith which many of
them had professed in baptism.</p>
<p>In the mountains of Ytui, which are not far from Pangasinan, father
Fray Juan de San Jacintho went on a journey at this time, accompanied
by only two Indians. Here he taught, settled their disputes, and
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb288" href="#pb288" name=
"pb288">288</a>]</span>brought them to the faith. These people were a
race of mountaineers, among whom other religious had not been safe even
with an escort of many soldiers; but the gentle manners of father Fray
Juan caused them to become calm, and many of them came sometimes to
Pangasinan to ask that religious might be given to them. Many years
passed before it was possible to provide them with religious; but the
father provincial had, as minister of Pangasinan, seen their pious
desires and wished to give them the religious. For this he requested
the sanction of the ordinary, and asked the governor for the royal
patronage. When the fathers of St. Francis learned this, they came and
said that this conversion belonged to them, because it was very near to
the ministry and the convent which they had in Baler. The order (which
needed religious in other regions) instantly yielded without any
dispute, permitting the fathers of St. Francis to take charge of these
Indians. This they did, but very soon abandoned them, since the region
was not one to be coveted, but was very unhealthy. As a result these
Indians remained for some time deprived of the ministry of the holy
gospel; and, what caused greater regret, they were morally certain to
apostatize, like many other Christians among heathens, since they were
children among idolatrous parents and kinsmen, without religious and
without instruction.</p>
<p>[In this year, 1609, father Fray Juan de Anaya departed this life.
He was a native of San Pedro de las Due&ntilde;as, two leguas from
Segovia, and was a professed son of the convent at Valladolid, whence
he came to this province in 1598. He was sent immediately to Nueva
Segovia, the conversion of which <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb291"
href="#pb291" name="pb291">291</a>]</span>had just begun. He learned
the language very quickly, and so wrought with them that he not only
taught them the gospel and the Christian life, but also civilization.
He showed them how to build their houses, and how to work their fields;
and taught them all other matters of human life, not only by
instruction, but by example. He sought out the Indians, and brought
them down from the mountains and the hiding-places where some, deluded
by their sins, had gone to hide from grace. Father Fray Juan was not
content to ask where they were and to send for them; but, trusting in
his natural strength, he went to look for them and brought them down
from the mountains, traveling through the rough and thorny places among
the thickets where they hid. He compelled them to enter upon the path
of their welfare, not by the violence of a tyrant, but by the force of
love and charity. When he was vicar of Pilitan, some of the poor
Indians lost all their harvest from an overflow of the river. Not
daring to wait for those who were to come and get the tribute, and
indeed through fear of starvation, they left the village, and many of
them fled to the mountains. Father Fray Juan was deeply afflicted
because of the danger which their souls ran. This grief and his many
labors affected his health, and finally brought on a flux, from which
he died. Another religious, a subordinate and companion of Father Juan,
father Fray Vicente Alfonso, died eight days later. He was a Valencian
by birth, and had been a sailor up to his twenty-fourth year. He
assumed the habit in the convent of Preachers in Valencia, and set a
good and humble example as a religious. He was very charitable, giving
away even his clothes to the poor. In <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb292" href="#pb292" name="pb292">292</a>]</span>the province of
Pangasinan, in the month of August, 1609, there departed from the
miseries of this life father Fray Francisco Martinez, a native of
Zacatecas, and a son of the convent of Mexico. He came to Manila in
1598, and was assigned to Pangasinan, where he learned the language of
the natives with great perfection. He was constant in labor and in
prayer. To defend the Indians, he did not shrink from suffering or fear
the perils of the sea. On one occasion, when he had gone to Manila on
this account, he fell into the hands of Japanese pirates on his way
back to Pangasinan, and was several times in danger of death, with the
pirate&rsquo;s knife at his throat, who intended by such terrors to
increase the ransom. Death called him from his labors and sufferings.
He rejoiced, and died a most holy death.]</p>
<p>In this year the most reverend general of the order, seeing how many
great things were wrought by the medium of the divine grace through the
religious of this province, and condemning the silence with which they
hid and covered them, without giving any account of them even to the
general head and superior of the order, issued a mandate to the
provincials that they should every year, on pain of incurring mortal
sin, give him information of what took place in this province of the
Philippinas, Japon, and China in the conversions of the heathen and the
extension of the holy Church, the service of the divine Majesty, and
the edification of the people of Christ. In addition to this, they were
to give an account of the state of our order in each province,
declaring how many and what convents it included, how many religious it
possessed, and of what virtue, sanctity, learning, and good example
they were; telling if <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb293" href=
"#pb293" name="pb293">293</a>]</span>any of them, after having done
illustrious things, had died gloriously; and recounting all other
matters which might be an honor to God, a source of comfort to the
religious, and an adornment and decoration of our religious order.
Together with this mandate, he wrote with his own hand the following
letter, from which may be seen the high esteem in which he held this
province. The letter is in the archives of the convent of Manila.</p>
<div class="blockquote">
<p class="first">&ldquo;Very reverend Father Provincial: Father Fray
Alonso Navarrete has given me good news of the great devotion, spirit,
and continual preaching in this new province. In this I have felt very
great satisfaction; but it would be desirable that I should receive
more detailed reports with regard to matters there, and particularly
with regard to what has been done for the conversion of the heathen, by
the grace of our Lord, in those kingdoms of China and Japon. This
knowledge would be of great service to our Lord, great edification to
our fellow-men, and great honor to our holy religious order. On this
account and in order that you, very reverend Father, may have the merit
of obedience, it has seemed good to me to send you the enclosed
mandate. This is sent, however, still more that it may serve as a
memorandum for the fathers provincials who may succeed your Reverence
in that province, because I know that there may be some carelessness in
this respect. Orders have already been given that friars religious
shall go to that province to preach and assist your Paternities in the
conversion of the heathen. Would that it might please our Lord that I
might go with those for whom our Lord has prepared so great rewards in
heaven. Your prayers, very reverend <span class="pagenum">[<a id=

<h3 class="main">The venerable father Fray Bartolome de Nieva, and
brother Fray Pedro Rodriguez</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">[Death fell heavily upon our fathers in this year,
seizing the best on every side. In Manila it cut short the thread of
the life of father Fray Bartolome de Nieva. Father Fray Bartolome was a
native of Nieva in Castilla la Vieja. While still a layman, he went to
the Indias in the search for wealth. He spent some years in Mexico; and
in spite of the great wealth of that country, the luxury of life there,
and the agreeable climate, he could not be satisfied or find peace.
Hence he determined to change his course of life, that he might find
the calm for which he sought. Though he was already a grown man, he
became a child in following the duties of a religious order. He assumed
the habit in the convent of Sancto Domingo in that illustrious city,
and began not only upon the elements of the religious life, but upon
those of grammar. He did well in the studies of arts and theology, and
by the aid of the Lord he came forth a religious of great spiritual
qualities&mdash;prayer, penitence, and prudence, both spiritual and
temporal. He joined a company of religious who passed through Mexico in
the year 1594, on their way to the Philippinas. He was too old to learn
the language of the Indians, but he accompanied the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb295" href="#pb295" name=
"pb295">295</a>]</span>brother who taught and baptized the Chinese in
the hospital for that people; and thus assisted the other minister,
whose duty it was to live in the hospital. When he determined to go to
the Philippinas his companions in Mexico strove to prevent him, because
he suffered from several infirmities, and the labors in the Philippinas
were known to be very severe. The Lord, however, gave signs that He
desired him to go. He showed especial devotion to the holy Virgin and
was a useful and devoted minister. The Lord gave father Fray Bartolome
wonderful powers of spiritual conversation, and of insight into
character; and even some powers of prophecy, of which a number of
illustrations are given. Through him the Lord healed not a few sick. A
letter of his is reported at length, in which he incites a sinner to
give up his evil way of life, and shows a knowledge of the man&rsquo;s
heart which could only have been given him by God. Other instances of
the same sort are cited and an account of the holy death of father Fray
Bartolome is given.</p>
<p>At the same time there died brother Fray Pedro Rodriguez, a
companion of the first founders of this province. He was most closely
associated with those who taught and baptized the Chinese. During his
whole life he had sole charge of the temporal affairs of the hospital.
Father Fray Pedro was not content with receiving those who came, but
had persons to inform him if there were any sick in the orchards or
quarries, or other places where the Chinese who live about Manila were
gathered for work; and immediately sent to have them brought to the
hospital. He often went in person to bring them, and, no matter how
offensive or disgusting their diseases, he cared <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb296" href="#pb296" name="pb296">296</a>]</span>for
them with his own hands. He waited upon them at all hours of the day
and night, caring for their bodies; and he strove to teach them the
things necessary for the salvation of their souls, as soon as their
sickness gave him an opportunity. He suffered greatly from asthma; but,
in spite of this affliction, he constantly employed the discipline of
stripes&mdash;not upon his flesh, for he had none, but upon his bones,
which were covered with nothing but skin; insomuch that some Spaniards
came to look at him, regarding it as a marvel that such a living image
of death should be able to stand. His head was like a skull with eyes
in it, but so sunken that it seemed almost as if he had none. The truth
is that he ate no more than sufficient to sustain him in this
condition; yet he was so attentive and careful to provide dainty food
for a sick man that the religious were sent there to him during their
convalescence. He had no greater pleasure than this and his unexpected
success in converting some heathen. The Lord provided him with these
pleasures, which served him as food and drink to sustain his life. To
the two hours of mental prayer observed in the whole province he added
two others daily, continuing them after that which follows matins, and
prolonging them till dawn. As soon as daylight appeared he left the
work of Mary to go to that of Martha in caring for his sick, giving
them breakfast after their own custom&mdash;which is followed in all
the care that is given them, and in everything done for them. In spite
of all these labors he thought so humbly of himself that one day when a
religious heard him uttering heavy groans and deep sighs, and asked the
cause, being unable to refrain from doing so, Fray Pedro answered that
it was because he was so evil that, though he had so many times prayed
to <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb297" href="#pb297" name=
"pb297">297</a>]</span>the Lord for a trifle of His love and charity,
he had not gained it. The superior desired to try him as to his
obedience; and seeing that he labored with such delight at the
hospital, and took such joy in serving the sick, he determined to find
out if there were some self-love hidden in all this. He therefore
directed him to leave the hospital, and to come to the city and take up
the office of sacristan in the convent. Fray Pedro immediately obeyed,
and, going into the sacristy which was entrusted to him, he fulfilled
his duty with cleanliness, neatness, and good grace in all things, just
as if he had exercised it all his life, and had never been occupied
with the other. He was accordingly directed to return to the hospital,
where he was more needed. The governor, Don Juan de Silva, went to
visit the hospital; and when he saw this brother with nothing but bones

such reverence for him that he kissed his hand, and offered him his
favor for all things of which his hospital had need, and arranged to
grant him all that he wished, for the governor looked upon him and
venerated him as a saint. At the time of his death, about three
thousand who had died in the hospital had received baptism. In the
intermediate chapter which took place in the following year honorable
mention was made of this religious.]</p>

<p class="first">[The events which happened in the case of this father

nearest to Him; and I should <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb298" href=

light if they were not attested by three notable circumstances. The
first is that he never formed his own judgment about what happened, but
submitted the matter to a learned and spiritual man. The second is,
that father Fray Luis kept such silence about these things that he only
revealed them under the solemn mandate of his superior. The third is
the innocence of his life, and his marvelous virtue. A formal
certificate as to these three circumstances is given at length; it is
by Fray Juan de Sancto Thomas, and is dated at Manila, August 10, 1615.
Father Fray Luis Gandullo was a native of the town of Aracena in the
archbishopric of Sevilla, and was born of a rich and noble family. At
the age of fourteen he made a vow to assume the habit of the Dominican
order. This vow he was unable to carry out for eight years, because of
his duties to his widowed mother and his two sisters. While still a
youth, he was favored with a vision of the Virgin, which was followed
soon after by a vision in which the devil appeared to him. After his
two sisters were settled in life a certain trouble befell him in his
own country, which obliged him to leave it and to go to the Indias. He
dwelt for some time in Nueva Espa&ntilde;a, where he lived with some
freedom, the Lord preparing to drive him, by the very thorns which he
should find in this road, to the religious life. His ancient desires to
become a friar of St. Dominic returned to his mind, and he began to
arrange with the prior of the convent of the city of Puebla to assume
the habit. The prior and the friars of the convent, being asked by him
if a secret business pledge which he had made had any validity,
declared that it had no force in conscience, and would not hold
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb299" href="#pb299" name=
"pb299">299</a>]</span>him in a court of law if the party concerned
would tell the truth of the case. He assumed the habit and waited for
fourteen months to be professed. While he was looking for his
profession to take place his creditor entered the convent, declaring
that they were taking away his money by permitting the novice to enter
the profession, since he could earn what he owed in the secular life.
Upon this, the superior commanded Luis to lay aside the habit; but the
Lord punished the creditor by burning a great deal more of his property
than the debt amounted to. Luis, who knew that the obligation was
merely a confidential agreement, refused to pay it because he did not
owe it. He was ordained as priest, having determined to become a
secular clergyman. Under this condition he prayed God to help him
fulfil his vow; and afterward had visions, among them a dreadful one of
the devil in the form of a snake. Being constantly attended by visions,
he determined to carry out his vow, and one night heard a voice calling
to him, &ldquo;Luis!&rdquo; He answered, &ldquo;Lord!&rdquo; and the
voice went on to say, &ldquo;Rise, and go to Mexico to assume the
habit.&rdquo; It seemed to him that it was the voice of his dead
brother. His conduct when he came to the convent was such that the
brethren there decided to grant him the habit and the profession
together, since he had already completed his novitiate. When the
founders of this province went through Puebla, father Fray Luis desired
to accompany them, but was unable to carry out his wish at that time.
He received intimations from a holy woman, a penitent of his, that the
Lord favored his desire to come to this province; and to this
intimation were added other supernatural signs. A great scandal having
arisen <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb300" href="#pb300" name=

Luis felt called upon to preach against the viceroy; he was condemned
to exile in the Philippinas, and received the sentence with joy. He
accompanied father Fray Juan Cobo, who was exiled for the same cause,
as is narrated in chapter twenty-four of this history.]</p>

historically. Its chief city is Nagasaki, which about 1586 was wrested
from the daimi&ocirc; of Omura by Taik&ocirc;-sama, and declared the
property of the central government. The Dutch maintained a factory
there, although under humiliating conditions and restrictions, from
1639 to 1859. Another notable town in Hizen is Arima, where the
Christians were so cruelly persecuted in 1637. The daimi&ocirc; of
Hizen, mentioned by Aduarte, was probably Nabeshima, prince of Saga,
who was a favorite with Iyeyasu.</p>

Organtinus (Sommervogel can find no distinctive Christian name) was
born at Brescia in 1530, and entered the order in 1556. He set out from
Lisbon for India in 1567; and soon went to Japan, where he spent the

<p class="footnote">Murdoch and Yamagata&rsquo;s <i>History of Japan,
1542&ndash;1651</i> (Kobe, 1903), gives this Jesuit&rsquo;s name as
Organtino Gnecchi (or Soldi), and the date of his arrival in Japan as
1572; and furnishes considerable information (partly derived from
Charlevoix) regarding Gnecchi&rsquo;s labors in Japan.</p>
